<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>There</span> was a puffing as of labored breath, a
shuffling of feet in the hallway, a banging and
clattering sound, and then a voice cried:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where you have ’um, Master?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ned Newton looked up from his desk and
glanced across the room at Tom Swift who was
poring over a mass of blue prints. The young
inventor smiled at his equally youthful business
manager as Ned remarked:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s your cute little giant Koku up to
some of his interesting tricks again! Sounds as
if he’d caught Eradicate by the hair of his bald
head and was bringing him in upside down!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Plague take those fellows!” muttered Tom,
a look of annoyance passing over his face. “If
they don’t stop this everlasting clashing to see
who is going to do things around here, I’ll get
rid of them both! That’s what I will!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ned Newton laughed—laughed so hard that
a pencil he had been using flew out of his hand
and fell to the floor, breaking the fine point the
young manager had put on in order to work
over the financial affairs of the Swift Construction
Company. Then Ned’s face sobered as he
noted his broken pencil and he exclaimed:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, soapsuds!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why the giggles?” asked Tom a bit impatiently.
He had been buried in such deep
thought that he resented the interruptions—not
only the interruption of the noise outside his
private office, but Ned’s laughter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I was only laughing because you’ve
threatened so many times to get rid of Koku and
Eradicate. But you’ve never done it,” went on
Ned, “and you never will.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, I never will, I suppose,” agreed Tom
slightly chuckling. “Though they are mighty
annoying at times with their everlasting——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He did not finish the sentence, for again there
came from the hall those strange sounds and
once more the voice asked:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where you want ’um, Master?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It all depends, I should say, on who ‘ ’um’
is,” laughed Ned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It can’t be Rad,” remarked Tom, rising from
his chair to go to the door. “If it were he’d
have let out a yell long ago. It’s got so lately
that he makes a fuss if Koku looks at him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Afraid he’ll turn him white, I reckon,”
chuckled Ned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>By this time Tom Swift had opened the door,
revealing that Koku, the jungle giant, alone
stood there, waiting for orders. Contrary to
what Ned Newton had suggested, the big man
did not have in his grasp Eradicate Sampson,
the old colored servant of the Swift household.
Between Koku and Eradicate there was an everlasting
feud, due to the fact that each one loved
and wanted to serve Tom and resented the
other’s efforts in the same field of endeavor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Koku held something else—something
that, when Ned caught a glimpse of it, caused
the young manager to exclaim:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My word, Tom, what’s the idea of the treasure
chest?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>For it was nothing less than that which the
giant held up on his shoulder—a great, massive
oak chest bound with heavy strips of brass.
And, as if that were not enough to hold the chest
together, there were in addition two strips of
wrought iron around either end of it, the strips
terminating in hasps which dropped over massive
staples, there to be fastened with heavy
brass padlocks which tinkled and clanged with
a suggestive sound as Koku stood holding the
big box.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Koku, I didn’t know this had come,”
remarked Tom, and all his annoyance at the
interruption to his thoughts passed. “I have
been waiting for it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Jes’ comed,” remarked Koku, whose English
left much to be desired, though he generally
managed to make himself understood. “Two
mans bring ’um off truck. Want to fetch ’um
up here. I laff an’ say Koku brung. Them
mans laff say no can do. I laff two times and
I give mans push and bring ’um here. Here
’um am.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So I see,” remarked Tom with gentle sarcasm.
“And I suppose in refusing the offers
of the truckmen who delivered my chest you
knocked them seven ways or more.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Just cast your gaze out of that window, Ned,
and see if you can observe two huskies with fire
in their eyes who will make a demand on the
Swift Construction Company for damages
caused by personal injuries from this little follower
of mine. And as for you, Koku, how
many times must I tell you not to go about
pushing! You aren’t playing football, you
know!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where you want ’um?” was all Koku answered,
still holding the heavy chest as though
it were but a pasteboard box. “I put ’um
down then I go bring up mans an’ show ’um I
can do!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You let those men alone!” and Tom laughed
in spite of himself. “You’ve got me into trouble
enough, as it is. But put the chest down there,
and then go and ask my father if he feels well
enough to come here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Boss Swift no come, I carry him,” said
Koku simply.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“None of that, unless he wants you to, Koku!”
ordered Tom in so sharp a tone that the giant
knew he must obey.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Aw right,” he murmured. He put the massive
brass-bound chest down in the middle of
the room, the keys, which were tied to the padlocks,
jingling and clanking as he did so. Then,
as the giant left the room, Ned drew his head
in from the window and remarked:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There are two huskies down there, dusting
off their clothes and looking indignant.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Just as I thought,” groaned Tom. “I’ll
have another demand on me for monetary damages
on account of Koku’s confounded zeal in
my behalf. Here, Ned, run down with these
cigars, like a good chap, and stave off the row,
will you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sure, Tom!” The young manager grabbed
a handful of cigars from a box some one had
sent Tom, but which the young inventor never
used, and hurried out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Meanwhile Tom Swift, left to himself, walked
over to the great new chest, and, cutting loose
the keys, fitted them into the locks, there being
two, and threw back the cover.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This will hold the most valuable of my
secrets until I can get the concrete storage vault
made,” he remarked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was still looking at and admiring the chest
when Ned came back. In his hand the young
man still held the cigars.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wouldn’t they take them?” asked Tom
quickly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I didn’t get a chance to give them the
smokes,” was the answer. “Just as I got down
there Koku came out the back door, and you
should have seen those fellows make a dash for
their truck. They’re breaking the speed laws
yet, I reckon,” and Ned sat down in a chair and
laughed heartily. “They seem to have had
enough of Koku’s pushes, Tom.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hang it all!” muttered Tom. “Well, I’ll
have to square those fellows next time I see
them. Maybe they won’t make any trouble.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Judging from the way they streaked it down
the road, they won’t come back here unless
they’re hauled. But what’s the idea of the
treasure chest, Tom? Some new invention?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, it’s just a plain, strong chest. I had it
made to store away my secret inventions—the
formulae, plans, blue prints and so on—until
I can put them properly in a vault that I’m going
to construct underground.” As Tom spoke
he began putting into the chest a number of
bundles of documents and drawings. “I had
the chest made in Mansburg, and I was just
wondering when they were going to deliver it
when Koku brought it up,” he added.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Those plans and blue prints must be worth
a lot of money,” remarked Ned, with an appraising
glance at them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, yes, you might say that,” admitted
Tom, though not at all boastfully. “The tidal
engine alone, when I get it perfected, ought to
bring in a pretty penny—that is, if dad and I
decided to sell it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“When you perfect it!” exclaimed Ned.
“Why, it works like a charm now!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I know the model does,” admitted Tom.
“But that doesn’t say it’s commercially practical
yet.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To judge by some of the offers you got for
even a small interest in it, I’d say it was a humdinger!”
exclaimed Ned. “But then your name
goes a long way, Tom. Once let it be known
that your company has something new on the
market, and you’re overwhelmed with offers.
Take that gyroscope air flier your father helped
work out——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not so loud, Ned!” cautioned the young inventor.
“I’m not ready to let the latest news
of that get out yet. As you know, with the
new stabilizer, it works on quite a different
principle.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Right! But there’s no one around here now
to catch your secrets, Tom.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You never know when some one is around,”
was the cautious observation as the young inventor
continued to pack blue prints into the
chest. “It’s best to be on the safe side. We
didn’t think any one was listening when you
and I discussed plans for the new turbine, and
yet we nearly got dished out of that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s so—my error!” apologized Ned. “Are
the plans for that going into the new chest?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes; and for my new idea that may result in
automatically stopping railroad trains and preventing
accidents,” went on Tom. “I have
great hopes of that and also of my new mammoth
telescope.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Telescope!” exclaimed Ned. “You haven’t
said anything to me about that, Tom. What’s
the idea?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, it’s pretty hazy as yet. But I have a
notion that we haven’t begun to reach the limits
of telescope work yet. If by means of present
instruments we can bring the moon to within
apparently forty thousand miles, why can’t we
double the size, or at least the power of the
telescopes, and make the moon seem only a few
hundred miles away? Then, by taking moving
pictures and enlarging them, we may be able to
settle the disputed point as to whether or not
the moon is inhabited. Yes, I’ve got a lot of
work to do on my telescope, and also on the
farm tractor. I’ve got a notion I can improve
the tractor, though I guess Ford beat me to it,
and holds all the tricks, for he can make them
in such vast quantities that he could outsell me
and underbid me, even though I could better
the machine a little.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I wouldn’t advise, as your financial
manager, bucking up against the Ford interests,”
remarked Ned dryly. “We’re in pretty
good shape, have a nice balance in the bank,
and all that, but I want to see it stay there.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So do I!” laughed Tom, as he continued to
pack into the chest thousands of dollars’ worth
of valuable patent papers. “I’m not going into
any wild schemes, Ned.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wouldn’t advise it,” went on the young
manager. “Especially in view of what may
happen soon,” he added.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s going to happen?” asked Tom
quickly and a bit apprehensively.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, I thought I might soon be requested
to act as best man at a certain ceremony in
which the talented Tom Swift was a party of
the second part, and a certain Mary Nestor
party of the first part aforesaid in manner following,
to wit, that is to say, and all the rest
of it!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Cut it out!” laughed Tom, blushing slightly
under his tan. “But if I ever do need a best
man you’ll be it, Ned.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thanks. I hoped as much. Well, when
you get all your documents in that chest of
secrets it will be worth a pretty penny, Tom.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Chest of secrets!” laughed Tom. “That’s
a good name for it, Ned. Yes, quite a little
fortune,” he went on. “I had the chest made
secure and heavy on purpose so it couldn’t
easily be carried away. Maybe I had it made
a bit too heavy. Let’s see if we can shift it out
of the middle of the room, Ned.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The chest, nearly filled with documents which
Tom had taken from his desk and the office
safe, was not locked. The two young men attempted
to lift it, but it was beyond their
strength.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’ll have to send for Koku,” remarked
Tom. “Though I expect him back any moment.
I sent him to call dad here. He may have some
papers he wants to put in the chest.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hark!” exclaimed Ned, raising a hand for
silence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Immediately thereafter a great crash sounded
on the roof of the building—a thundering, vibrating
and nerve-racking crash, and above the
din a voice cried:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bless my steering wheel! I didn’t want to
land here!”</p>

<div><h1 id='ch2'>CHAPTER II<br/> <span class='sub-head'>BIG OFFERS</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Tom Swift</span> and Ned Newton glanced at each
other. In spite of the apparent gravity of the
situation the young men could not help smiling.
For well they knew that voice, and they could
judge what had happened.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s Mr. Damon!” exclaimed Ned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And he must have made a forced landing
from an aeroplane on the roof above us!” added
Tom. “Lucky for us he didn’t come through.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Lucky for him, too, I should say!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ned made a dash for a stairway leading to
the broad, flat roof of the building that housed
Tom’s executive offices and also one of the shops
of the Swift Construction Company. The
young inventor followed his financial manager.
Others of the plant—workmen, machinists, and
apprentices—were also on their way to the roof.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tom and Ned, going up a private stairway
and through a scuttle, were the first to reach
the scene. There a curious sight met their eyes.
Seated in a small monoplane—a kind invented
by Tom Swift himself—was Mr. Wakefield
Damon, a friend of the family, a very eccentric
but lovable character, forever “blessing” any
and everything that took his fancy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hello, boys!” he greeted Tom and Ned,
blinking his eyes at them in a curious fashion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, for the love of spark plugs!” cried
Ned. “What happened?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are you hurt?” Tom asked more practically,
though a quick glance assured him that the
plane was whole, though one landing wheel was
slightly out of true, and that the solitary passenger
was still in the small cockpit.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bless my porous plaster, Tom, I don’t know
whether I’m hurt or not!” answered Mr. Damon.
“I came down so suddenly! I was aiming
to land in your regular flying field, but
something went wrong with the controls—it’s
a new plane, I haven’t had it long—and I find
myself here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mighty lucky you are to find yourself, I’ll
say,” murmured Ned, as a crowd of Tom’s men
gathered about the plane on the roof.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This smash,” remarked Tom, as he and Ned
were helping the odd man from his aeroplane,
“reminds me of the first time I ever saw you,
Mr. Damon. You were riding a motorcycle.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And it tried to climb a tree with me! Bless
my rubber boots, well do I remember that!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was owing to Mr. Damon’s disgust over
the accident to his motorcycle that Tom had
been able to secure it for a small sum. As related
in the first volume of this series, “Tom
Swift and His Motor Cycle,” the young inventor
was started on his sensational career by
the possession of this battered machine, which
he repaired and got in running order. On it he
had some exciting rides.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tom was in his early manhood. He, and his
aged and somewhat invalid father, an inventor
of note, lived in the Swift homestead in the town
of Shopton on Lake Carlopa. Tom’s mother
was dead, but he and his father were well looked
after by Mrs. Baggert, an efficient housekeeper.
Of late years Barton Swift had not taken much
active part in the rapidly growing business,
though Tom always consulted his father on
matters of importance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was at the suggestion of Mary Nestor, for
whom Tom had a very great admiration, that
the young inventor engaged his friend and
boyhood chum, Ned Newton, to look after the
business matters of the Swift Construction Company.
Tom never had reason to regret that
decision. For with Ned to look after money
matters, see to contracts, and the like, Tom and
his father were left free to exercise their inventive
ability.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Swift Company had gone into many
lines of activity, from building airships and
aeroplanes to constructing submarines and giant
cannon for the government. These brought
Tom and his associates money and fame, and
also hard work.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Just prior to the opening of this story Tom
had developed a new drill and a system of sinking
shafts for oil wells, and when, as related in
“Tom Swift and His Great Oil Gusher,” he
successfully demonstrated how quickly he could
get down to the oil-containing sand, he made
another big amount of money, not only for the
Swift Company, but for the Goby family as
well.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was after this that he began to think of
getting together in one central place all his
drawings, patent rights, secret formulae and the
like. To this end he had had constructed the
strong chest, and he and Ned had barely finished
putting into it most of the valuable documents
when the crash on the roof came.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He doesn’t seem to be hurt, Tom,” remarked
Garret Jackson, Tom’s shop manager, as he laid
Mr. Damon on a pile of coats and jackets which
some workmen hastily spread on the roof.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hurt! Bless my doctor’s bill, I’m not hurt
at all!” exclaimed the odd man. “I’m shaken
up, but I’m more worried about the plane than
about myself. Is it all right, Tom? I tried to
avoid the chimney, but I’m afraid one wheel
grazed it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, that’s what happened,” replied the
young inventor, as soon as he had made sure
his friend was not hurt and had had time to inspect
the craft. “You damaged it a little. But
I can easily put on another wheel. I have some
spare ones for that model.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Have you, Tom? That’s fine! Put one on
and I’ll fly off your roof. You may charge me
storage if I stay here too long,” and Mr. Damon
laughed in a way which showed, better than
anything else, that he had suffered no ill effects
from the sudden ending of his flight.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are you going to trust yourself again to
that plane?” asked Mr. Jackson.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course I’m going to fly again!” cried the
odd man. “A little bump like this doesn’t disturb
me. I’ve been in worse smash-ups; haven’t
I, Tom?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Off hand, I should say you had,” was the
smiling answer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Besides, I want to learn how to run this
jigger!” cried Mr. Damon, sitting up on the
pile of workmen’s garments while the men gathered
smilingly about him, for they all knew him.
“What did I do wrong, Tom? Or is the steering
gear out of order?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It seems to be all right,” answered the young
inventor, who had been looking at the mechanism.
“Tell me just what happened.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, as I say, I was coming over to see you.
Or, if I didn’t say that before, I tell you now. I
have a big offer for you, Tom Swift, a most important
offer. I’ll get to that in a moment.
But I was coming over in this plane, which I
bought only yesterday, and I decided to fly
across your shop and land in the meadow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But, just as I got here, I felt the machine dip
suddenly. First I thought I had struck an air
pocket, but I didn’t have time really to decide
what it was before I came down with a crash.
Luckily I was able to straighten her out a little
before I struck, so I made a slanting landing.
Otherwise I might have gone through the roof.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And right down on our heads!” exclaimed
Ned. “Mighty glad you didn’t!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So am I,” said Mr. Damon. “But what’s
wrong, Tom? I want to know so that the same
thing won’t happen again.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I guess you forgot that you were in a monoplane
instead of a biplane, Mr. Damon,” he
answered. “You banked too much on the turn.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s it, Tom! I remember now! I was
making the curve to head straight for the meadow,
and it was then a sort of side slip came.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” remarked the young inventor, “you
spilled too much air from beneath your wing
tips. You see in a biplane, with two surfaces,
the air is held in a sort of pocket and you can
afford to make a sharper bank on the turn. But
in monoplanes you must be more careful.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I will, after this,” promised Mr. Damon, as
he arose and walked about, albeit a bit gingerly
as though making sure he had no broken bones
or strained tendons.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Here, Koku!” called Tom to his giant helper.
“Hold up this plane while some of the men take
off the damaged wheel.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sure, Master, Koku do,” was the reply.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Go on!” cried another voice. “It doan need
no big fat giant to lift a li’l machine like dat!
I’ll do it fo’ you, Massa Tom!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>An old colored man with a fringe of white
hair around his black pate pushed through the
crowd of workmen toward the giant who was
already preparing to tilt the plane so the wheel
could be removed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You go or Koku push you!” warned the
giant with a threatening look at Eradicate
Sampson.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Huh! You go on!” was the contemptuous
response, and there might have been a battle
then and there had not Tom interposed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Rad,” he said, “you let Koku attend to lifting
the plane. It’s a bit heavy in spite of its
small size. You go down to the storeroom and
bring up the extra wheel.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hah, you ain’t so smart as you t’inks you
is!” taunted the colored man as he departed on
his errand, satisfied now that he could help his
young master.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They’ll soon have the machine in shape for
you, Mr. Damon, if you insist on trusting yourself
to it again,” said Tom, as he gave instructions
to his men. “And while you are waiting,
came on down and talk to dad. He’s always
glad to see you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right, Tom, I’ll do that. At the same
time I can attend to the matter that brought me
over here. Bless my Liberty Bonds, Tom, but
it’s very important! Big business, you know!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ned and dad and I are always ready to talk
business,” remarked Tom, as he led the way to
his office in which stood the new chest of secrets.
Mr. Swift was there, looking over some papers.
At the sight of the chest Mr. Damon exclaimed:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Packing up to move, Tom?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, just taking precautions so I won’t lose
any of my secrets,” replied the young inventor.
“There are so many of these plans and patents
now that dad and I thought we ought to have
them in one place, where we could easily get at
them in a hurry if need be.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s right,” chimed in Mr. Swift. “You
know I’m not as young as I once was, Damon.
I can’t expect to live much longer, and I want
everything in shape for Tom when I go.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nonsense! Bless my life insurance policy!”
laughed Mr. Damon, “you’ll be here for many
years, Mr. Swift. And lest you may be losing
interest in life, listen to this offer that I bring
you.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tom, you remember Mr. Blythe?” he asked,
turning to the young inventor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Surely! The man who got so excited when
he found what my oil well drill had done?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The same, yes. Well, he called on me yesterday.
He introduced some capitalists—big
men they are, too, moneyed interests of New
York and all that. Mr. Blythe introduced them
to me, and the upshot of it was, Tom Swift, that
they authorized me to make you a big offer for
certain rights in your tidal engine and mill machinery
patents. Now look here, Tom, there are
millions in it for you—millions! Why, bless
my bank book, it’s the biggest offer you ever
listened to, Tom Swift!”</p>

<div><h1 id='ch3'>CHAPTER III<br/> <span class='sub-head'>DIRTY WORK</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Mr. Damon</span> was easily excited and quite
likely to become enthusiastic over small matters.
None knew this better than Tom Swift,
and that, perhaps, accounted for the calm manner
in which the young inventor received the
news of “big interests” being after some of his
ideas.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, Tom, what do you say to it?” asked
the odd man, as he strode about the private
office, all trace of his recent crash having disappeared.
“Shall I tell my friend Mr. Blythe to
bring over his men who have the money?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” answered Tom slowly. “Just as much
obliged to you, Mr. Damon. But don’t do it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What, Tom Swift? Do you mean you won’t
sell a part interest in your tidal engine and mill
machinery for—say a million dollars?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Look here, Mr. Damon,” laughed Tom.
“If Mr. Blythe or his friends were to walk in
here now and lay down a million dollars in
cash, or certified checks, I’m not saying but
what I might accept their offer. A million
dollars is a lot of money.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I hardly believe, however, they would make
a bona fide offer of anything like that amount
for something of which they can have heard
only rumors, for neither of those inventions is
on the market yet—in fact, the mill machinery
is hardly past the experimental stage.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, Tom,” slowly remarked the odd character,
“maybe they wouldn’t exactly give you
a <span class='it'>million</span> in cold cash. I may have been a little
hasty in saying that. But Blythe certainly
said there would be millions in it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Maybe he meant for <span class='it'>him</span>,” suggested Ned
pointedly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hardly,” observed Tom. “Mr. Blythe is a
square man and you can depend on what he
says. But, as a matter of fact, I prefer to develop
these inventions myself rather than sell
them, or even an interest in them, at this stage
of the game. What do you say, Dad?” and he
turned toward his father.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I agree with you, Tom,” answered the elder
inventor. “I haven’t gone as deeply into these
two latest ideas of yours as I have into some
of the other things, but from what I have seen
I believe they will be very valuable, and will
help along human progress.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We must think of that, as well as of the
money we might make in certain inventions. It
may be that this syndicate of men wishes to
keep off the market something that might displace
some present method they control. And
it might be that Tom’s ideas would help save
human life. In that case it would be your
duty, Tom, to develop the matter, even if you
never got a cent for it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s the way I feel about it,” said Tom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then we don’t go into this?” asked Ned,
who, as usual on occasions like this, was making
shorthand notes of the talk to be preserved for
future reference.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, we’ll just drop it,” decided Tom. “I’ll
go on trying to perfect the two devices, and
later on, Mr. Damon, if I decide to sell an interest,
I’ll let you know and you can tell Mr.
Blythe. Shall I send him a formal declination
through Ned or will you tell him? I, personally,
think that as long as the offer has come indirectly
through you, you had better be the
messenger.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, bless my ketchup bottle, Tom! you
aren’t going to turn down that offer like this,
are you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m afraid I am, Mr. Damon.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And you agree with him, Mr. Swift?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Whatever my son says I shall stand by,” answered
the old inventor, with a smile. “No
hard words to you, Mr. Damon, you understand,
but——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I’m not interested in it—only to help
Tom!” was the hasty answer. “It doesn’t mean
anything to me. I’m not working on a commission.
All I want is to learn to run my new
little plane. But I’m not going to let you stand
in your own light like this, Tom. I’m going to
tell Blythe to send those men over to see you!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No use!” laughed Tom, waving his hands.
“I won’t be so discourteous, of course, as not to
see them, but I won’t do any business with
them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, maybe you will,” suggested Mr. Damon
hopefully. “You don’t know yet any details
of their offer, you know.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>At that moment another noise was heard outside
the room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I tell master!” boomed out the voice of
Koku, the giant.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Go ’way, big man!” cried Eradicate. “Didn’t
he send me fo’ de wheel an’ ain’t de wheel on
now? I’m gwin tell him dat de plane am ready
to run offen de roof.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No! I tell!” disputed Koku.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They’re at it again!” murmured Ned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Shivering hoptoads!” cried Tom testily. “If
they don’t stop this everlasting contention I’ll
fire them both!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He strode to the door just as Eradicate’s voice,
tense, calm, and ominous exclaimed:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Look yeah, big man! I’s gwin in an’ tell
Massa Tom ’bout de plane bein’ ready. An’
ef you all doan stand to one side I’s gwin to bust
you a lambaste in de nose wif dis yeah monkey
wrench.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The dire threat evidently had its effect, for
when Tom opened the door Eradicate stood
there, proudly smiling, and Koku, vanquished
by the firm bearing of his small enemy, was
hurrying around the corner.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, sah, Massa Tom,” said the colored man,
with a broad grin as he fingered the large
monkey wrench in his hands, “I’s done come to
tell you dat Mistah Damon’s machine am all
salubrious now an’ he kin ride it down offen de
roof if so be as he likes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thanks, Rad! I’m going to do that at
once!” broke in the odd man.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, Mr. Damon, we’ll leave it to you,
then, to communicate with Mr. Blythe,” Tom
said. “We won’t send any letter.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, don’t turn the offer down just yet,”
pleaded Tom’s friend from Waterford. “You
may regret it. Wait a few days. Now I’ll see
if I can do a little better with the plane than I
did at first.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’ll go up and see that you get started
right,” said Tom. “I’ll leave you in charge of
the chest of secrets, dad, until I come back. I
have about all my papers in, but I thought you
might like to put in some of yours.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, Tom, I should, thank you. Rad, I’ll
ask you to help me gather them up from my
office.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Knowing his chest of valuable papers would
be safe in the care of his father and Eradicate,
the young inventor went with Ned and Mr.
Damon to the roof.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The workmen had put on a new wheel and
made one or two other repairs to the slightly
damaged plane. A test of the motor showed
that it was in fine running order, and Mr. Damon
took his seat in the small cockpit.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I suppose it’s all right to take off from here,
isn’t it, Tom?” he asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, yes,” replied the young inventor. “I’ve
often done so with bigger planes than this.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The roof over Tom’s office and the adjoining
shop had been built with special adaptability
to aeroplanes, and a little later, when the engine
had throbbed and roared after starting, Mr.
Damon had no difficulty in getting into the
air.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The little plane gathered speed, sped across
the roof, and, reaching the edge, dipped down
a moment and then sprang into the air like a
veritable bird, which it resembled more than it
did anything else.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Damon was observed to lean over the
edge of the cockpit, wave his hand and shout
something down to those on the roof.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did you hear what he said?” asked Tom of
his business manager.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No; but it probably was that he’ll send
Blythe over to see you,” chuckled Ned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He needn’t; it will be of no use. I’m going
to work on the tidal engine and the mill machinery
for my own purposes,” declared the
young inventor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Those on the roof watched for a time the soaring
little plane, becoming smaller as it receded
from view.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He seems to know how to run it all right,”
observed Ned, as he and Tom prepared to return
to the office.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, yes, he just made that one mistake,” answered
Tom. “He’s pretty careful as a rule.
But I’ll never forget the look on his face as he
sat on the ground after his motorcycle tried to
climb a tree. It was the funniest thing I ever
saw!” and Tom laughed at the recollection.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Swift was putting into the great oak
chest some of his papers when the young men
rejoined him. As Rad closed the lid and Tom
snapped the locks, the telephone rang.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll answer,” offered Ned. “And shall I
have Koku come here, Tom, and put that chest
in the corner?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, you’d better. We can’t budge it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll move it!” rashly offered Eradicate, but
a tug at the handle on one end showed him the
futility of pitting his feeble strength against
the box. “By golly, she suah do stick to de
flo’!” he gasped. “But ef I had mah strength
I could do it!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hello! Hello!” Ned was saying into the
telephone. The room grew quiet and Tom heard
his manager exclaim:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You don’t mean it! No! The hound! Say,
wait until I get over there!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What is it?” asked Tom, thinking perhaps
some accident had befallen Mr. Damon. “What’s
the matter, Ned?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dirty work!” was the answer. “Dirty work,
that’s what the matter is, Tom! My father has
been falsely accused! I must go to him at
once!”</p>

<div><h1 id='ch4'>CHAPTER IV<br/> <span class='sub-head'>LIBERTY BONDS</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Ned Newton</span> turned back to the telephone,
from which he had moved but a moment to answer
his chum and employer, and to his father,
on the other end of the wire, the young manager
said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll be with you right away, Dad! They’re
not going to get by with anything like that—not
in a thousand years! Don’t let them bluff
you. It’s just a rotten bad mistake, that’s all.
I’ll be right with you. What’s that? Will
Tom let me come? Well, say——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tell him I’m coming with you!” shouted the
young inventor vigorously as he caught the import
of what his chum had said, and his voice
was so loud that it carried to the other end of
the wire.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He heard you,” said Ned. “Thanks, Tom.
Yes, Dad, I’ll be right along.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He clicked the receiver back into place and
with burning indignation on his face turned to
Tom and Mr. Swift.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is your father in trouble, Ned?” asked Barton
Swift. “If so you must say to him that
Tom and I will do all in our power for him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thanks,” and Ned’s voice was a bit broken
as he spoke the word, for he was greatly affected,
as they all noted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tell me in a few words what it is,” suggested
Tom. “I want to know so we can go
prepared to help him. Maybe we’d better stop
and get Mr. Plum.” Ralph Plum was a lawyer
of Shopton who attended to legal matters for the
Swifts.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I guess maybe we’ll need a lawyer,” answered
Ned dejectedly. “For my father has been arrested.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Arrested!” exclaimed the Swifts in a breath.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. But of course he’s innocent,” and Ned
proudly threw up his head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No question about that, old scout!” said
Tom, clapping his chum on the back. “But
what’s the nature of the charge? Tell me so I
can telephone to Plum,” and he went over to
the instrument on his desk.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He is accused by Renwick Fawn of the theft
of a good many thousands of dollars’ worth of
Liberty Bonds,” answered Ned. “Dad didn’t
have time to give me all the story over the telephone,
but several times before this he has
spoken to me about mysterious thefts of these
securities from the National Investment Company,
where he is employed, you know. Dad
spoke of these thefts, and even mentioned that
the firm had engaged a private detective to try
to trace the thief. Now, like a bombshell, father
is accused and arrested.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s all a mistake, of course,” said Tom.
“Oh, Operator, get me Main 1576, please, and
in a hurry if you can. Of course it is all a
mistake,” and he resumed his talk to his chum.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But think what the accusation means to dad,
to mother and to me even though it is afterward
proved—as it will be—that my father had
nothing to do with the matter!” burst out Ned.
“He is disgraced forever because that sneak
Fawn thinks he knows it all! Oh, there has
been dirty work all right!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who is this fellow Fawn?” Tom wanted to
know.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A new manager they got at the Investment
Company,” replied Ned. “I have heard dad
speak of him. He’s one of these efficiency
birds—everything done by clockwork, plenty
of pep, a go-getter, and all that rot! I’d like
to go get him! But, oh, the disgrace to
dad!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t worry about that!” exclaimed Mr.
Swift. “No one who knows your father can
ever think him disgraced, even if he were arrested
for the theft of all the Liberty Bonds
Uncle Sam ever put out!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Right-o!” cried Tom. “Oh, hello, is this Mr.
Plum’s office? Yes, I want to talk to him—very
important—Tom Swift speaking!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The name of Swift worked like magic, even
in such a ceremonious office as that of Mr.
Plum, and a moment later Tom was pouring
out a quick statement of the matter, suggesting
that the lawyer hold himself in readiness to
go with Tom and Ned to the office of the investment
concern where, it appeared, Mr. Newton
was being held in custody, preparatory to
being arraigned before a police officer for commitment
to a cell.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll call for you in my electric runabout,”
finished Tom. “What’s that—can it go? Mr.
Plum, when that car was built it was the speediest
one on the road, and it has never yet been
passed! Yes, we’ll be there in a jiffy!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Turning to his chum as he hung up the receiver,
Tom remarked:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now come on, Ned, we’ll get a move on.
But we’ll take a few sinews of war with us!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Quickly he opened the big chest he had locked,
and from an inner compartment in it he extracted
a sheaf of crisp bills whose yellow color
told of high denominations.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They always have to accept bail in these
cases, Ned,” remarked the young inventor, “and
cash always talks. Your dad will be able to
sleep at home to-night.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thanks,” murmured Ned, and, though he
did not say it, he had had a horrible vision of
his beloved father spending the night in a cell
like some convicted felon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Look after the treasure chest, Dad!” called
Tom to his father as he hurried out with his
chum.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I certainly will if you’ve got any more cash
in it,” said the aged inventor, with a smile. “I
didn’t know you planned to keep money in
there, Tom.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t—not as a rule. But this was some
that came in when Ned wasn’t around and I
didn’t have time to bank it, and it didn’t belong
in the office safe. Now, Ned, hustle’s the word!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tom Swift had not misnamed his electric runabout.
Though it was one of his earlier inventions,
it was still in excellent shape and it was
just the kind of machine for a quick, speedy
trip. Running to the garage where it was kept,
the two young men leaped in and soon the
motors were humming as the “juice” from the
storage battery was turned into them. Tom
rounded a corner of the drive on two wheels, it
seemed, and was soon off down the road, causing
Ned to jam on his hat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’ll stop and pick up Plum,” said Tom,
in his chum’s ear as they whizzed along. “Then
we’ll go right to the office of this concern. We’ll
have this thing over before it’s fairly begun. Is
there anything more you can tell me as we
travel?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not much,” Ned answered. “You know
dad has been with this concern for a long time.
It was only recently that I heard him speak of
this new manager and his ways. It seems Fawn
took a dislike to dad, who is a bit old-fashioned
in some of his ideas. Not enough pep, I suppose,
for the dirty hound!</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And, as I told you, there has been going on
the stealing of Liberty Bonds for some time.
But as this wasn’t in my father’s department he
didn’t think much about it. He has charge of
the mortgages. Then, like a bolt out of the
blue, they accused him to-day—even pretended
to find some of the missing bonds in his desk.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course he indignantly denied the accusation
and asked for permission to telephone me.
Fawn didn’t even want to allow that, so dad
told me over the wire, but the president of the
concern put his foot down and said I should be
informed. Now you know as much as I do.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Which isn’t much,” commented Tom. “It’s
a case for Plum all right. We’ll be at his office
in another minute.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They found the lawyer waiting for them. Despite
all his other legal work, it would never do
to neglect any of the Swift family interests.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Outline it to me quickly, Tom,” said Mr.
Plum, as he got into the electric runabout. This
Tom did, giving a brief account of the case as
related by Ned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’ll waive an immediate arraignment and
have him admitted to bail,” decided the lawyer
as they neared the office where Mr. Newton was
detained a prisoner.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Father and son met and shook hands—hard.
Tom nodded to some of the men of the investment
company whom he knew and with whom
he had done business. He noted one self-important
individual walking up and down. It
was Mr. Fawn, he guessed, and this was confirmed
a minute later when this sleek person
said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, Mr. Newton, you have had your way—your
son is here, and some other friends, I
presume. Now I demand that this man be
locked up on the charge I make against him,”
he went on. “Deputy, you can do your duty.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Just a moment,” put in Mr. Plum suavely.
“I represent the defendant in this case. I ask
to examine the warrant.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You can’t see it!” snapped out Mr. Fawn.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, yes, he can,” said the deputy sheriff who
had served it. “That is always the privilege of
the defendant’s lawyer.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, well, all right,” snapped the accusing
manager of the concern.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Plum glanced over the document, which
was brief, and, in effect, charged Mr. Newton
with embezzling, converting to his own use,
stealing, taking and carrying away certain valuable
property of the National Investment
Company, to wit Liberty Bonds to the value of
thirty-thousand dollars.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This is a bailable offense,” said the lawyer.
“We ask to be taken before a magistrate with
the power of fixing bail.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He ought to be taken to jail—that’s where
he ought to be taken! And he would be if I
had my way!” snapped Mr. Fawn.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That will do, Mr. Fawn,” sternly said the
president of the concern, Amos Bell. “This is
a very serious matter,” he went on. “Mr. Newton
is an old friend of mine. I must insist that
strict justice be done him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thank you,” said Ned’s father feelingly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He has a right to bail,” said the deputy.
“Judge Klein is sitting at the court house now.
I can take him before him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then we’ll go at once,” said Mr. Plum.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A little later they were before the bar of
justice—Mr. Newton a little pale, but standing
firm and upright. Ned flushed and indignant,
with many a vindictive look at the manager of
the investment company. Tom was clutching
the bundle of notes in his pocket. The lawyer
seemed to take it all as a matter of course.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What is this case?” asked the old and
learned judge, and when it had been explained
and when he had read the accusation in the warrant,
he said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I take it that you do not wish to plead now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, your honor, we do!” interposed Mr.
Plum. “I wish to enter a plea of not guilty for
my client. We waive arraignment now, and
ask that he be admitted to bail, which we are
prepared to furnish in any amount.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Um,” murmured the court. “I see he is accused
of taking bonds to the value of thirty-three
thousand dollars. I believe I must fix
bail at ten thousand dollars.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was a gasp from Ned. Mr. Newton
seemed to turn a trifle paler. Tom whispered
hoarsely to his chum:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Great bean pots! I brought only five thousand
dollars with me!”</p>

<div><h1 id='ch5'>CHAPTER V<br/> <span class='sub-head'>IVAN BARSKY</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Mr. Plum</span> did not seem startled, nor even
much impressed, by the judge’s announcement
of the large amount of bail he would require to
set Mr. Newton free. Perhaps the lawyer was
accustomed to such matters for his clients. At
any rate, as Tom said afterward, “he never
turned a hair,” but turned to Mr. Newton and
asked:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are you prepared to furnish that amount of
bail?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, no, I’m afraid I am not,” was the hesitating
answer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s going to happen, Tom?” whispered
Ned to his chum. “Do you think dad will have
to be locked up?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, I think there must be some way out,”
replied Tom. “Great hoptoads! I never thought
we’d need more than five thousand dollars.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s an awful lot of money to get on a moment’s
notice,” sighed Ned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The five thousand’s about all the cash we
have on hand just at present,” stated Tom
Swift. “But of course we can raise a lot more.
The question is, though, can we do it in time?
Let’s see what Mr. Plum is saying.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The lawyer was addressing the court.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I suppose,” he said, “your honor will be content
with a real estate bond or that of a surety
company?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Either one, Mr. Plum,” was the answer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Turning to Tom the lawyer asked:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are you prepared to go security for Mr.
Newton in this amount?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, or twice the amount, if necessary,” Tom
answered. “But I have only five thousand in
cash here with me——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was a gasp of surprise from some spectators
in court, and the judge and the prosecutor
smiled at one another.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But my father and I will sign a bail bond
in any amount,” Tom went on eagerly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I fancy that will satisfy the court. And
you too, Mr. Prosecutor, will it not?” asked the
lawyer, nodding to the county prosecutor, to
whose lot it would fall to try the case against
Mr. Newton, if it went to trial.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If the Swift firm signs a bond I’ll be satisfied,”
said Mr. Nixon, the prosecutor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What about us?” burst out Mr. Fawn.
“Don’t we have something to say in this matter?
I don’t want that man to go free. He
stole a lot of our Liberty Bonds.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Order! Order!” called the court constables,
and the judge banged with his gavel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You have nothing to say in this matter,”
said the judge to Mr. Fawn. “The amount of
bail has been fixed sufficiently high, and if a
bond is furnished this defendant will go free
until his trial, no matter what <span class='it'>you</span> think about
it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Abashed, the manager of the investment company
slunk back in his seat and Mr. Plum conferred
for a few moments in whispers with the
judge and the prosecutor. The upshot of it was
that Tom hurried off in the electric runabout
and brought his father to the court house. Mr.
Swift and Tom signed the bail bond, pledging
themselves to pay to the county the sum of
ten thousand dollars in the event that Mr.
Newton was not on hand to stand trial
when called; and the matter was ended for the
time being.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“May I go now?” asked Ned’s father, who
was in a very nervous state over it all.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You may, indeed,” said the judge courteously.
“Your friends have gone bail for you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I—I thank you—very much,” faltered Mr.
Newton, and then he and Ned walked out a little
ahead of the others, for Ned was affected,
too.</p>

<p class='pindent'>However, they soon recovered their spirits,
and when they were in the runabout, which was
larger than the name implies, Mr. Newton with
a sad smile, turned to Tom and asked:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How does it seem to associate with criminals?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t know!” laughed the young inventor.
“I haven’t been with any yet.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thanks!” replied Ned’s father. “I suppose
I needn’t assure you, my friends, that I am innocent
of this charge?” he added.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You don’t need to say a word!” cried Tom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But what is it all about, Dad?” asked Ned.
“What’s the game, anyhow, and why have they
picked you for the goat?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t know,” was the sober answer. “I
can’t tell. I wish I could. All I know is that
the Liberty Bonds have been stolen—at least,
so Fawn says—and the fellow accuses me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wouldn’t be surprised if he had stolen
them himself!” burst out Ned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Be careful, son,” warned his father in a low
voice. “Don’t get rash. But what will the
next move be in this matter?” he asked the
lawyer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, your case won’t come up for trial for
several months,” was the answer. “Not until
fall, anyhow. In the meanwhile, if you wish,
I will look into it for you and prepare a defense.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I was going to ask you to, Mr. Plum,” put
in Tom. At the same time he gave the lawyer
a glance which told that astute legal man that
Mr. Newton was to be at no expense in the
affair. As a matter of fact, Mr. Plum was
under a yearly retainer to look after all the
Swift interests.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then perhaps, Mr. Newton, you had better
come to my office and talk the matter over,”
suggested Mr. Plum. So he and the late prisoner
were deposited in town, and Tom, his
father and Ned went back to the shop.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, a lot has happened in the last couple
of hours,” remarked Ned, as he watched his
friend put back into the chest the five thousand
dollars which had not been used.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I should say so!” agreed Tom. “I think
we might as well knock off work for the day,
Ned. I sha’n’t need you any longer, and I
guess you’ll be glad to get home and comfort
your mother.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I will. I telephoned her from the court
house that dad would not have to sleep in a
cell. But she’ll want to hear all the particulars.
I’ll be on hand in the morning.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Take your time, old man. There’s nothing
special on. And on your way out please send
Koku here and I’ll get him to shift this chest.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ned looked at the substantially bound box
and smiled faintly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Some chest, I’ll say,” he observed. “And
when you get all your patent papers and blue
prints and other drawings in it, Tom, it will
be a regular chest of secrets.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So you observed before, Ned. And let me
add, the chest of secrets will be a mighty valuable
one.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ned went off and a few minutes later Koku
came in, grinning broadly to think that he was
needed to help his master. With ease he moved
the heavy chest and its valuable contents to a
small room opening out of the main office where
Tom worked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nobody but Koku move ’um big box like
that!” exclaimed the giant a bit proudly when
the transfer had been made.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Better not let Rad hear you say that,”
chuckled Tom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pooh! Rad! Blow ’um head over ’um’s
ears!” grunted the giant.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That evening Tom and his father discussed
the accusation against Mr. Newton, though as
they had heard few particulars there was little
that could be said except that unbounded faith
in him was expressed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tom was in his office early the next morning—much
earlier than usual, in fact, for he wanted
to work on a new idea in regard to his plan for
stopping trains automatically so that collisions
or other accidents would be avoided. It was
Tom’s hope that this invention could eventually
be applied to his powerful electric locomotive,
about which details have been given in another
volume.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tom was soon deep in a mass and maze of
figures, computing the power needed to stop such
an immense force as was represented by his big
electric machine. He was considering a wireless
attachment to bring automatically into play
the stopping force when Eradicate shuffled into
the room. The colored man was chuckling.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, what is it now, Rad?” asked Tom, not
altogether pleased at being interrupted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ha! Ha! Dat Koku giant, he sleepin’ yit!”
chuckled Rad.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is that all you come in to tell me—that
Koku is sleeping yet?” exclaimed Tom, a bit
wrathfully.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He suah sleep!” went on Rad. “I git ahead
ob him. I’s de early worm dat tickles de birds
dis mawnin’.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What do you mean—early birds and
worms?” and Tom smiled in spite of himself.
“No one is going fishing, is there?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I doan know ef he’s gwin fishin’ or not, Massa
Tom, but he’s outside waitin’ to come in.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who is?” the young inventor inquired.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Man whut wants to see you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good night, Rad! Why didn’t you say it
was a visitor instead of gassing away about
Koku sleeping and worms and birds and all
that? Though I suppose you’re so proud of
having gotten ahead of that giant of mine you
can’t help feeling good.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Das right, Massa Tom!” chuckled Eradicate
Sampson. “I done fool dat giant dish yeah
mawnin’. But heah’s de letter he done gif me
fo’ you,” and the colored man extended a card.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tom accepted the card and holding it to the
light read inscribed the name.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Um—Ivan Barsky!” murmured the young
inventor, casting his memory back over many
names representing many men to see if this
one fitted in anywhere. “I don’t seem to recall
him,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He done tole me dat he’s a stranger to you
all,” confided Rad. “But he says it’s mighty
’portant business.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Perhaps it is—to him,” chuckled Tom, who
was accustomed to having many strangers call
on him for help or to ask him to lend his talents
toward perfecting some crazy invention.
“Well, Rad, show him in.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yas, sah,” and the colored man shuffled out,
to return presently ushering in a man at whom
Tom shot a quick look. The youth saw before
him a man of short stature but powerful
build. He had a shock of black, bushy hair,
and it was difficult to tell where his hair left
off and his beard began, the latter also being
black and bushy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The name Ivan was right,” thought Tom.
“He’s a Russian all the way through.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mr. Swiftski?” asked the man in questioning
tones, and with a trace of surprise, seemingly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You can leave off the <span class='it'>ski</span>,” said Tom. “But
I’m Mr. Swift.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pardon—but eet is that I do not the talk of
your country know so well. In my talk there
are so many who are like that. But your pardon
I again ask—eet is to see so young a man
that I am taken by astonishment.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re a pretty slick article,” said Tom to
himself. “I don’t know that I’m going to like
you, but I’ll give you one more chance.”</p>

<div><h1 id='ch6'>CHAPTER VI<br/> <span class='sub-head'>FIRE</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='sc'>Sit down</span>,” said Tom, realizing that he had
not as yet extended this ordinary courtesy to his
visitor. “What can I do for you?” he went
on.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are the one I want to see—yes?” inquired
Ivan Barsky, in laborious English, halting
for many of his words.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I’m Tom Swift,” was the answer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have documents to Tom Swift,” went on
the man. “But I had—what you say—expected
to see an older personage.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I guess I’m old enough,” replied Tom,
with a smile. “But my father is older. However,
he has retired from the active business of
the concern, so I reckon you’ll have to deal
with me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is of a pleasure to do so, I assure you,”
and the man smiled, showing his white teeth
amid the blackness of his beard. “Please to
read these.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He extended to Tom a sheaf of letters and
documents, which appeared to be epistles of
introduction. Some were written in what Tom
recognized as Russian and bore imposing
stamps. These last, with a smile, the inventor
passed back to Mr. Barsky saying:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“These don’t mean anything to me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They vouch for me in my country—Russia,”
was the reply. “They are from—what shall I
call heem—the Central Committee.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t know much about Russian affairs,”
said Tom. “But I’ll see what these letters in
English have to say. But before I go on, what
is it you want of me? If it is to help you
finance an invention, I tell you now I will take
on nothing new. If it is to work on some machine
you have started, that, too, is out of the
question. So it may save your time, and mine,
also, if I tell you this.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thank you, I have nothing of these,” said
the visitor. “Eet is that I wish to work for
you. I am an expert—what you call—mecheechanic,”
and he put several unneeded syllables
in the word. “Also I make those what you call—models.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, a pattern-maker!” exclaimed Tom. “I
understand. Well, excuse me and I’ll look over
your credentials.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He found several letters from well known
firms in the United States, saying that Ivan
Barsky had worked for them and had been most
satisfactory. He was spoken of as a good mechanic
and model-maker.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One letter rather raised Tom’s suspicions, for
at the conclusion it stated:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='pindent'>“We do not vouch for the morals of Ivan
Barsky, though, as far as we have observed, he
has a quiet, orderly disposition.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>“I reckon that was written by some secretary
who feared he was dealing with a Bolshevist,”
thought Tom. “Well, we may have some of
that ilk in the shop, but as long as they mind
their own business I can’t say anything. It’s a
part of their religion, I guess; and I don’t believe
Bolshevism will ever get a hold here.
However, if I do take on this chap—and I may,
for I need a model-maker—I’ll keep my eye on
him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Turning to his visitor, Tom handed back the
letters and said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“These speak very well of you—as a workman.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The man may have caught Tom’s hidden
meaning, for he burst out with:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That is all I am offering you—my talents
as a worker. For the rest, eet is my own affair!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Exactly,” agreed Tom. “Well, I’m inclined
to give you a trial, for we need some extra help
just now. Wait, I’ll see if my father is up yet.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Going to the telephone that was connected
with his father’s own room, Tom noticed that
the door leading into the small room where he
had stored his chest of secrets was open, leaving
the heavy box in full view. Tom closed the
door, though not before he had caught the dark
and snapping eyes of his visitor fixed on the
chest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Rad must have opened that door,” thought
Tom, a trifle put out by the incident. “I must
tell him to be more careful. He is getting old
and careless. But I hate to get rid of the faithful
fellow.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Swift was up, and he told Tom that he
would come down and talk to the Russian. In
spite of the latter’s labored English—he pronounced
all save a few words very well, except
for a peculiar intonation—Ivan Barsky was
able to give a good account of himself. He answered
Mr. Swift’s questions intelligently and
showed that he had been well apprenticed in
machinist work and in the making of models
and patterns.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A model-maker is what I’d really take him
on for, if you think it’s wise to hire him,” said
Tom to his father in a low voice as they discussed
the matter in the far end of the office.
“I am working on the new automatic stop
invention, and a great many models will be
needed. Our men are busy on other matters.
We might give this fellow a trial.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, Tom, you know I don’t usually interfere
in the shop matters,” said Mr. Swift. “I
appreciate the fact that you want to get your
new invention started. But I would think twice
before I hired this man once.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why Dad?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, for one thing, I don’t like his looks.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t, either. But we have just as dangerous
and anarchistic-looking fellows out in
the other shops.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know, Tom, but they have been with us
for years.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. But when they first came their appearance
was against them. So, if it’s all the
same to you, I’ll put this Barsky to work. But
I’ll tell Jackson to keep an eye on him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right. But it’s against my better judgment,”
and Mr. Swift shook his head as he
glanced toward the foreigner. “Still, he may
do good work for you, and speed is essential
just now. But have him watched.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I will, Dad. And now I won’t trouble you
and further. Here comes Ned, and we’ll get
started on the daily grind.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Swift, who was writing a book on certain
mechanical principles, was glad to be released
so he could go to his literary labors. After his
father’s departure Tom called a man from the
shop and sent his strange caller out to be put to
work.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who is his Royal Whiskerisky?” asked
Ned, as he put on his office coat and took his
place at his desk.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“His name is Barsky—Ivan Barsky,” replied
Tom. “I’ve just hired him,” and he gave a
brief story of the caller.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hum—Barsky,” mused Ned, with a smile.
“Well, all I have to say is that I hope his bite
isn’t as bad as his bark-sky!” and he put his
arm in front of his face to ward off a missile
which he expected Tom would throw at him
following this atrocious joke.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Men have been shot at sunrise for less than
that,” chuckled the young inventor. “However,
that reminds me, I must tell Jackson to
keep his weather eye peeled for this chap. I
don’t want him walking off with any valuable
templates.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He sent for the foreman, giving him some instructions
about the new employee, and Mr.
Jackson said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll look after him, Tom. I saw him go into
the pattern shop and sized him up as a tough
customer. Though sometimes those fellows do
mighty good work. And, as you say, we do
need an extra man or two.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then while Ned plunged into the financial
affairs of the company, which was his department,
Tom and his foreman went over certain
matters that needed looking after. For the
Swift Construction Company did a certain
amount of manufacturing, and orders were
heavy at this season of the year. So it was not
until nearly noon that Tom found a chance to
ask his chum:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How’s your father? Did he get over the
shock?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Somewhat,” answered Ned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course he isn’t going back there to
work?” went on Tom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I should say not! He doesn’t know yet
what to do. In fact, he’s like a man without
a country.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why not bring him here?” suggested Tom
quickly. “Jackson tells me that they are
rushed out in the shop on certain lines. This
will mean more office work, Ned, and I’m sure
you’ve already got all you can handle. I’d be
glad to have your father here—that is, if he’d
like to come.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I’m sure he would, Tom, only——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Only what?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know he wouldn’t like to think that you’d
taken him on out of charity.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Stow that talk!” broke in Tom. “That’s
all nonsense! We need an expert accountant in
addition to you, Ned. And while I can’t offer
your father as responsible a position as he held
with the investment concern, still I’d be glad to
have him come here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’ll come, Tom, I’ll guarantee that. I’ll
telephone him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So it was arranged, and that afternoon Mr.
Newton was given a desk near that of his son
in the office.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For several days wheels were rapidly humming
in the Swift shops. As Tom had said,
orders were coming in with a rush, and this,
together with work on new inventions, kept the
whole place busy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How’s your Bolshevist coming on, Tom?”
asked Ned one day.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Barsky? Why, he seems to be doing
very well, so Jackson tells me,” was the answer.
“He minds his own business and he’s a regular
wizard at pattern making. He hasn’t had a
chance to show what sort of a machinist he is,
but I reckon he’ll do. In fact, Jackson says, in
spite of his rather terrorizing appearance, that
the man is a find.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Glad of it,” replied the young manager.
“It’s always a sort of satisfaction to find you’ve
misjudged a man on the right side. Now in
regard to this order from the Simplex Supply
Company, if we ship them a hundred gross of
those dashers that ought to keep them supplied
for a month, and we can then use the machinery
to turn out those candy-wrapping machines for
the Cocoa Company.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right, Ned, I’ll leave that to you. I’ve
got troubles of my own here. Hello, that can’t
be the noon whistle, can it?” cried Tom, as a
blast smote the air. He looked up at the clock
on the wall, noting it was barely eleven, and
then Ned, after a glance from the window, cried:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s the fire alarm, Tom! There’s a blaze in
the pattern shop!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A moment later several voices took up the
shouts of:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Fire! Fire! Fire!”</p>

<div><h1 id='ch7'>CHAPTER VII<br/> <span class='sub-head'>A HURRIED EXIT</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>While</span> a fire is always a dangerous and
alarming matter in a big shop or a factory, that
contingency has been thought of and plans
made to meet the emergency. It was this way
in the shops of the Swift Construction Company.
They had organized a fire-fighting force,
and in each shop there was a reel of hose in addition
to several chemical extinguishers, the result
of Tom’s own inventive genius.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Besides this, a series of whistle alarms had
been worked out; a certain number of blasts
on the big steam siren giving the location of the
blaze. And it was the booming out of this
whistle that now sent out the alarm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come on, Ned!” Tom cried.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Newton, dropping his books, ran with the
young men.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s in the pattern shop, all right!” cried
Tom as he sped along. “I hope it doesn’t get
to those new models Barsky has been working
on for my train-stopping device. He’s got some
of my original drawings out there.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Every one connected with the Swift enterprises
knew the menace of fire, and when that
whistle blew every man and boy dropped what
he was doing and rushed to the location of the
blaze.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Eradicate was driving an old horse hitched
to a cultivator in the garden, and when he heard
the whistle the old colored man slapped the
reins down on his animal’s back and shouted:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“G’lang! Git a move on! We’s got to help
put out dat fiah!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But it was impossible to get up any speed
with a cultivator, the pointed teeth of which bit
deep into the earth as the old horse started forward
under the urge of voice and flapping reins.
Seeing that he was likely to be held there in the
garden, Rad hastily unhitched the horse, leaped
on its back, and then, with the traces flapping
and jingling, rode to the scene of the blaze.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Koku, when he was not using his great
strength to advantage at the works, employed
himself about the Swift house and grounds.
He happened to be watering the lawn just when
the fire whistle blew.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ho! Me got just the t’ing for fire!” cried
Koku. “Take squirty hose to ’um an’ put ’um
out!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Off he started on a run, but was soon brought
to a standstill when he reached the limits of the
hose which was screwed fast to a faucet. But
a little thing like this did not bother the
giant.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You no come I make you come!” he cried.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Exerting but a little of his terrible strength,
Koku gave one yank on the hose. It parted.
Then, with one end dangling in his big hands
while the other end, from which the water was
still spurting, was attached to the faucet, the
giant ran to the fire with the useless bit of
rubber.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It happened that Eradicate and Koku
reached the pattern shop at the same time, the
giant with his hose and the colored man on his
horse.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I put out fire!” yelled the giant. “See!
I bring hose!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And then for the first time he seemed to realize
that in pulling the hose apart he had cut
himself off from the supply of water. A queer,
blank look came over his face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hose he come with me—water no come!”
murmured the giant.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Golly! Ef dat ain’t jest like de big booby!”
chuckled Eradicate. “Dat’s about all de sense
he’s got!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was Eradicate’s triumph, for Koku was
completely flabbergasted by pulling the hose in
twain and did not have a word to say.</p>

<p class='pindent'>However, this was only a side issue. Before
Tom’s two jealous servants had arrived some
men in the pattern shop had already unreeled
the fire hose there and a stream was playing on
the blaze, while others came up, some with a
portable chemical extinguisher on wheels—a
powerful fire-fighting engine—and a little
stream from this served to end all danger.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tom directed the work of his men, and had
the satisfaction of seeing the danger rapidly
pass. The blaze was in a pile of wood and
other refuse in the pattern shop, and little real
damage was done.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, we came out of that rather better than
I expected,” remarked Tom, as he stood with
Ned and Mr. Newton surveying the still smoking
interior of the pattern shop.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I should say so!” agreed the manager, for
well he knew that it needed but a small blaze to
destroy many valuable patterns.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What is it, Tom?” asked Mr. Swift, as he
came up as fast as he could, having heard the
alarm of fire.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All over—nothing worth worrying about,”
Tom answered. “Fifty dollars will cover our
loss, and we’ve got insurance on everything.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Swift looked in, to make sure just what
had happened, and asked a few questions, to one
of which a man replied:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, the fire started near where that new fellow
was working.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You mean that Russian, Barsky?” asked
Mr. Swift sharply.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think that’s his name,” the man replied.
“We call him Whiskers in the shop.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There, Tom, I told you not to hire that
man!” said the young inventor’s father in a low
voice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But he had nothing to do with the fire,
Dad,” explained Tom. “He wasn’t even near
when it happened. I inquired about that.
The thing happened because a plumber’s blow
torch which one of the men was using to burn
off some stuff overturned when a pulley broke
and fell on it. Nobody’s fault at all. It was
just one of those accidents you can never foresee.
No one knew the pulley was split. The
man using the blow torch had taken all precautions,
but he couldn’t count on a pulley falling
on it from above. And Barsky wasn’t even
there.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Um! Well, I don’t like him just the same,”
said Mr. Swift.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I guess it’s all over,” remarked Ned to his
chum when it was seen that the last, smouldering
spark was out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” agreed Tom. “I must get back to my
desk. I want to finish those computations by
noon if I can, for I have to go to Mansburg this
afternoon.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’d better check up on this fire,” observed
Ned. “There’ll have to be a report made of it
to the insurance company, small as the damage
was, and we’re entitled to a claim.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll leave it to you,” returned Tom. “You’d
better splice that hose, Koku,” he said, with a
smile. “And look out for your horse, Rad.
He might kick at some of the men. He’s a
cross old beast.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He won’t lessen I tells him to. An’ they
ain’t but one pusson I’d like to hab him plant
his hoofs on!” snorted the colored man.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think I can guess who that is,” remarked
Ned, with a chuckle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The men from the other shops dispersed to
their several places, the fire hose was reeled
back into place, and Rad urged his horse back
to the garden cultivator. Koku, still staring
in puzzled fashion at the half length of broken
hose in his hand, wandered back to his post,
murmuring:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hose, he come along ob me—water, he no
come. How can do?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Clearly it was a problem too deep for his
brain.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tom hurriedly entered his private office, his
mind intent on many things but chiefly concerned
with a knotty problem in applying sufficient
force to a train to stop it and at the same
time, doing no damage to the passengers or to
the tracks or the train.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s got to be done with a recoil system,
either of springs or hydraulic pistons,” said the
young inventor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As he entered the room Tom was surprised
to see the form of Ivan Barsky, the new Russian
pattern maker, making a hurried exit from it
by the rear.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For a moment the young man was too surprised
to quite take in the significance of the
matter. As he slowly realized that strict orders
had been posted to the effect that none of the
men from the shop was to enter the private
offices unbidden, Tom called:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What were you doing in here?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sharp suspicion entered his mind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Who was this foreigner and what was his
game?</p>

<div><h1 id='ch8'>CHAPTER VIII<br/> <span class='sub-head'>A SECRET LISTENER</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Tom Swift</span>, in a crisis, was not one to think
first and act afterward. Usually he did his acting
first, and this was one of those instances.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Like a flash of fire it ran through his mind
that now was the best time to ascertain what
object the foreigner could have in breaking the
regulations and entering Tom’s private office.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With the end in view of settling the matter
then and there, Tom dashed across the room
and out of the rear door by which Barsky had
left. The young inventor had a glimpse of the
Russian hastening along just ahead of him. He
was making good time, too. But Tom Swift,
too, was a sprinter. In spite of all the machines
for locomotion that Tom had invented, he could
still run.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He caught up to Ivan Barsky and seized that
individual by the arm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hey! Wait a minute!” cried Tom, not very
dramatically, perhaps, but effectively.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Eh? What eet iss?” The man seemed to
hiss the words in his peculiar way. There was
a frightened look on his face and, also, one of innocence,
real or assumed. “You weesh to see
me, Mr. Swift?” asked Barsky.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It might be the other way around,” announced
Tom grimly as he faced the man. “It
rather looks as if you wanted to see me—going
into my office when I wasn’t there. Don’t you
know that’s against the rules?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pardon—I did not know eet.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, it is! I’m telling you now! No one
from the works allowed in the private office
without permission. Now, why did you go
there—especially when I was out fighting the
fire, which was in your department?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Fire? Yes, I hear the wheestle, but I see
that so soon the fire he is out so I cannot think
that it to a great deal amounts. I hope none of
my new patterns were burned.” He seemed
genuinely anxious on this score.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Luckily the fire was only in some rubbish,”
explained Tom. “But that has nothing to do
with the fact that you were in my office in my
absence. What did you go there for?” and the
voice of the young inventor was stern.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh—I my presence must explanation? Yes,
of courseness. I go there to get heem!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He held up to Tom a complicated slide rule,
often used in making intricate computations
that, otherwise, would entail much work at
figures.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I need these for that train stop pattern I
am making for you, Mr. Swift,” the man explained.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I thought you would need that rule,
and I intended sending it out to you,” Tom said.
“But you should not have gone to my office to
take it while I was absent.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pardon! I did not know you were not at
home. Also did I not know of the prohibition
against entering the office when you were not
in. I saw the rule—I need heem very much to
make the pattern of finished appearance. So
I take the rule and hurry back to my bench.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You hurried all right—I’ll say that,” murmured
Tom grimly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes—I am of a hurry kind. Most of us
Russians are. Now that I have of explanation
made, eet is permit that I take these?” and he
again held up the rule.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, yes, I suppose so,” conceded Tom
slowly. He could not say anything else, it
seemed. There was such an air of innocence
about the man that to break it down, if it were
pretended, required better evidence than Tom
at this moment possessed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Certainly Barsky had taken nothing more
than the slide rule, and he needed it in his work.
Tom felt that the man should have had it before,
for it was the most essential tool. How then,
could he find fault with the foreigner for taking
what, obviously, was within his right? Of
course he had broken a rule, but this might be
overlooked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So Tom had to say it was all right and let the
matter go at that.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Only don’t go into my office again without
permission,” concluded the young inventor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Naturally not—since you have told me,”
said Barsky. “I shall send word in advance of
my veesit next time,” and with a bow he took
himself off.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hum,” mused Tom as he strolled back to his
own quarters. “Now was that sarcasm or not?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He thought he was perhaps rather exaggerating
the importance of the incident, and was
somewhat put out by the construction Barsky
might put on being thus reprimanded until Tom
happened to look in the room where the chest
of secrets was kept.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Not only was this room open, but so, also,
was the chest itself and in plain view were a
number of valuable plans and drawings.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hang it all!” exclaimed Tom. “I wonder
if that chest was open while Barsky was in here
after that rule? It must have been. Some one
is getting careless; but as it may have been I
who opened that box and forgot to close it when
the fire whistle blew, I’d better not say anything
about it. Ned or Mr. Newton might think I
was hitting at him. Yes, I’ve got to be more
careful, with strange workmen about and valuable
new plans under way.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tom looked carefully over his chest of business
secrets, and, as far as he could ascertain,
nothing had been disturbed. He knew in a
general way what was in the box.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I think the safest way to do,” he told,
himself, “would be to have Ned make a list of
all the documents in there. Then we can check
them over from time to time. I’ll do that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So, without saying anything to his chum
about the visit of Barsky, Tom told the young
manager to list all the documents in the chest
after attending to the fire insurance matter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We can’t be too careful of these invention
papers,” remarked the author of many of them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re dead right you can’t,” agreed Ned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The fire was but a small incident in the day’s
work at the Swift plant. Fires in such a big
shop were not at all uncommon; so matters were
soon running smoothly again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>During the next two or three days Tom paid
several visits to the pattern department, and
each time he went there he found Barsky busily
at work, using the slide rule with an expertness
that gave Tom a good opinion of the fellow’s
ability in his own line of work.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m glad I hired him—that is, so far as getting
what I wanted done,” Tom said to his
father. “He makes patterns better than any
man we ever had.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I have looked at some of the models he
has turned out,” Mr. Swift replied. “But I
can’t get over a certain uneasy feeling when
I am near that man, Tom. It’s a sort of fear, I
believe.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nonsense!” laughed the young fellow. “You
are imagining things, Dad. Barsky is no ten-thousand-dollar
beauty, I grant you that, for he
has enough hair and whiskers for a dozen sofa
cushions. But we aren’t running a beauty parlor,
and he does do good work.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, Tom. Well, I’ll leave it to you. It’s
more in your department than mine, anyhow.
By the way, is there anything new in the case of
Mr. Newton? We must do all we can to help
him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We will, Dad. I don’t know that there are
any new developments. I’ll ask Ned. But
Plum has orders to look after that case to the
best of his ability. Now I suppose you want
to get back to your book, don’t you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If you don’t mind, Son,” answered Mr.
Swift, with an anxious look toward his desk
which was littered with papers. The talk had
taken place in the older inventor’s private office.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right, I’ll leave you with your pet,”
laughed Tom, for the new book was Mr. Swift’s
chief joy and pride. “But I’d like to have a
talk with you this evening, Dad.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“By all means, Tom. I’ll be free then.
Come and chat. But just now I want to finish
that chapter on hydraulics. I find it most fascinating,
and I am using some of the data you
evolved when you built the big submarine.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I fancy we discovered a new principle
or two there,” answered Tom, with justifiable
pride. “And you’re welcome to quote me at
any length you wish, Dad,” he finished, with a
laugh.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right!” chuckled the old inventor.
“You’re somewhat of an authority, Tom, on a
few subjects.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Swift plunged into his literary work before
Tom had reached the door on his way out,
so eager was he to resume work on his book, and
Tom was glad his father had something of this
sort to interest him and give him an object in
the declining years of his life.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tom, what say, we go to a ball game this
afternoon?” suggested Ned when the young inventor
returned to his office. “It’s too nice a
day to work.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tom glanced out at the sunlight dancing over
the green grass. He looked at his paper-laden
desk and then at the clock.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ned,” he suddenly exclaimed, “I’m with
you! And if you weren’t already drawing a
bigger salary than you’ll ever be worth, I’d give
you an advance for the valuable suggestion.
How about you, Mr. Newton? Will you come
to the game?” he went on, thinking to take the
man’s mind from his trouble over the missing
Liberty Bonds.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thank you, Tom, no. There are a few
things I want to get straightened out on my
books.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Better let them go for a time,” suggested
Tom. “You’ll do better work afterward.
That’s the way I feel about it. I’m in a sort
of maze on this train-stop device. I’m up
against a stone wall. So I’m going to a
ball game and I order you two to come with
me!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, if it’s an order from the boss—that’s another
matter,” laughed Mr. Newton. So, Tom,
having seen to it that his chest of secrets was
securely locked, brought around the electric
runabout and all three went to the ball game.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is there anything new in your case, Mr.
Newton?” asked Tom, as they sat in the grandstand,
watching the players warm up.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, Tom, not a thing. I am leaving everything
to Mr. Plum, as you suggested. He hasn’t
reported anything new.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Has that fellow, Fawn, or any of the firm
pestered you about the missing bonds?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No. But Fawn sneers every time he sees me.
I fancy he is much put out that I am not in
jail.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You needn’t worry about that,” laughed
Ned, though in his heart he keenly felt the disgrace
that had come to his father.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is this seat taken?” asked a young lady’s
voice behind Tom, and he turned to look into
the smiling face of Mary Nestor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course not!” he exclaimed, rising, as did
his two companions. “Always room for one
more. I didn’t expect to see you here, Mary,”
the young inventor added.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And you didn’t think of inviting me, I suppose,”
said Mary demurely. “I think I will
sit by Ned.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If you do I’ll discharge him, and then he
won’t like you,” said Tom, as he made room beside
himself for the girl to whom he was engaged.
“I’m awfully glad you’re here. We
came in such a hurry—on the inspiration of a
spontaneous suggestion by Ned—that I never
thought to ’phone over and see if you wanted
to come.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, all right—I’ll forgive you!” the girl
laughed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But there was a quick exchange of looks between
Mary and Ned. In fact, Mary had suggested
privately to Ned that he bring Tom to
the game, as she intended to meet him there.
Often it was necessary to use a ruse to get Tom
away from his absorbing work of inventing
things.</p>

<p class='pindent'>However, here he was, and soon he was enjoying
the game with his friends. It was not
much in the way of a ball contest, but it served
to pass away the afternoon and change the current
of all their thoughts.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That evening after supper, Tom and his
father drew their chairs together in the living
room for one of their old-time chats. Mr.
Swift was in a pleasant mood, for he had done
some work on his book that afternoon which
gratified him very much and about which he was
enthusiastic.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tom, how are things going?” he asked his
son.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Very nicely, indeed,” was the answer. “Of
course, I am not making as much progress as
I’d like to on that train-stop device, but it will
come. And when it does, I think it will be
worth good money to us.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, that, and some of the other inventions
we have under way, will be worth sixty thousand
dollars, I think, when they are completed.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, that estimate may be a bit high,” returned
Tom slowly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No!” protested his father. “I put it low.
I think they’ll run over sixty thousand dollars.
Why, that mill machinery idea of yours——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hark!” exclaimed Tom softly, holding up
a hand to caution silence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What is it?” asked his father.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I heard some sort of a noise outside on the
porch.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tom arose to go toward one of the windows,
the shades of which were drawn down. But
before he reached the casement Eradicate came
hurrying into the room, very much excited.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s the matter, Rad?” asked Tom
quickly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Somebody on de piazzy listenin’ at de window!”
exclaimed the colored man. “I jest been
to see dat de henhouse was locked up, an’ I done
seen somebody on piazzy! I runs up, but he
runs away an’ I didn’t cotch him! But dey
was somebody listenin’!”</p>

<div><h1 id='ch9'>CHAPTER IX<br/> <span class='sub-head'>MARY’S MESSAGE</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Once</span> again Tom Swift had occasion to act
quickly, as he had when he discovered Barsky
in his private office. Without waiting to question
Eradicate, the young inventor made a dash
for the door. A moment later he was outside,
looking for a sign or trace of the mysterious
intruder.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the night was dark, there was no moon;
and Tom, coming from a lighted room, was at
a greater disadvantage than otherwise would
have been the case. It was not until several
seconds had passed that the young man could
make out objects in the gloom, and none of these
objects was the unknown person he sought.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Still Tom was not going to give up so easily.
He shouted to Koku, and when the giant joined
him and when Eradicate had come shuffling out
the three began a hurried search around the
house for the secret listener.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I guess he got away,” sighed Tom.
He was greatly disappointed when it was evident
that no one was to be caught.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He suah has,” agreed Eradicate.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What sort of man was it?” asked Tom. “I
suppose it was a man, Rad, and not a woman?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, yes, Massa Tom! It suah was a man
aw right! An’ he was a sorta big man, but
stoopin’ ober like, leanin’ down an’ tryin’ to look
under de window shade.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why didn’t you jump on him, Rad?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dat’s jest what I was tryin’ to sneak up an’
do, Massa Tom. But I done sneezed jest when
I got by de piazzy, an’ he done hears me an’
jumps away.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“By golly! I cotch him ef I been dar!” cried
the giant. “I take ’um in my two hands—so.
I squoze ’urn—so!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Truly there would have been but little chance
for the trespasser had Koku got his hands on
him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ha! Ha!” chuckled Eradicate. “He go so
fast, Giant, dat he make you look like a worm
crawlin’ along!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The giant was not very fast in his movements,
and he realized this. Still he did not like to be
taunted about this failing, and he now made a
reach for Eradicate, who, however, easily eluded
his enemy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come now! None of that!” ordered Tom
sharply. “I guess this fellow, whoever he was,
might have been only a tramp. Take a stroll
around for a while, Koku, and see if he comes
back.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sure, Master, I watch.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“An’ I’ll be on the lookout, too,” offered
Eradicate.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Look around, both of you, and don’t scrap.
Do you hear? Don’t scrap between yourselves.
I’m getting tired of it!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I be good to Rad, Master,” promised the
giant.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Huh! You better, ef you all knows whut
good fo’ you!” chuckled the colored man.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tom went back to his father, finding the old
gentleman somewhat nervous and upset.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What was it, Son?” he inquired.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, just some tramp, I think,” replied the
lad easily. But in his own mind he was disturbed
by the incident.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wonder if that was Barsky or some of our
old enemies?” mused Tom to himself, when he
had gone to his own room after some further
talk with his father concerning the various inventions
and patents. “There’s always a chance
of some of the old gang trying some of their
tricks.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But what object could any one have in listening
to the talk between dad and me? We
only mentioned generalities, and what we said
would have been of no value to any one. Still,
whoever was listening didn’t know that. They
may have hoped to pick up some information
that could be used against us.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But though he was worried and a bit apprehensive,
Tom did not dwell long on this phase
of the matter. He knew it would do little, if
any, good.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Still he was not so foolish as to omit all precautions,
and a little later he went outside to
see if Koku or Eradicate had seen any further
signs of the intruder.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Both the giant and the colored man reported
that they had seen no one, and Tom sent them
to bed, after giving orders to see that the house
was well locked for the night.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The shops, some distance away, were well
guarded by watchmen, as well as by a system
of electrical burglar alarms, a bell of which was
set up in Tom’s room. No one could get in or
over the high fence which surrounded the works
without disclosing his presence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tom was a little apprehensive that in the
night the alarm bell might ring, telling him
that some one was trying to sneak into the
factory. However, the hours of darkness passed
uneventfully and with the coming of morning
Tom’s fears passed away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He went out to look around the porch on
which the mysterious listener had crouched beneath
the window, but there were no clews that
he could follow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll just have to let things take their course,”
decided Tom. He reported the matter to Ned,
as he generally did in such cases.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wouldn’t worry about it,” said Ned cheerfully.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m not,” declared Tom, but his manager
could see that he was and that he could not get
his mind down to work. At last Tom himself
became aware of his nervous condition, and
shortly after noon, throwing his pencil down on
his desk, he exclaimed:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m going out for a ride, Ned. Come along.
It will clear the cobwebs out of our brains.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Going in the runabout?” asked Ned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, in the little biplane. She’s just been
tuned up and runs like a sewing machine. We’ll
take a spin up in the clouds.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ned considered for a moment, looked at a
mass of papers on his desk, and answered:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, thank you, I’d better not go. Besides,
Mr. Plum just telephoned that he’d like to see
me about dad’s case, and I want to run over
there.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right,” agreed Tom. “Take all the time
you want, Ned. But I don’t want to go skylarking
alone. I think I’ll ’phone Mary. I
haven’t had her up in the biplane for some
time.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, you and Mary go for a spin,” replied
Ned. “Only take care that it isn’t a tail-spin.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The <span class='it'>Hummer</span> doesn’t indulge in such antics,”
replied Tom, with a laugh. “But first I’d
better see if she’ll tune up as she did the other
day. I don’t want to get Mary out in her and
then have something go wrong. I’ll just run
her out, Ned, and give her a warming up.
Then, if everything’s all right, I’ll call Mary.
You can look after things here, I suppose?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, either dad or I will. He’ll be back
soon, and then I’ll take a run over to Plum’s
office.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tom owned several planes, but of the two-winged
variety the one he best liked was the
<span class='it'>Hummer</span>, a small but speedy craft. This machine
was kept in a hanger near the flying field,
and it did not take the young inventor long to
have her run out that he might test the engine.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She sure sounds sweet, Mr. Swift,” remarked
the mechanician who assisted him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, Dirk, she’s throbbing like a wild duck.
I guess I’ll take her up for a time.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Going back to the office Tom reported to Ned
that everything about the <span class='it'>Hummer</span> was in good
shape and that he would probably be gone for
the remainder of the day. As there was no
good landing place near the home of Mary
Nestor it was necessary for her to come to
Tom’s flying field, and while he was getting
ready he sent one of his men for the young lady
in an automobile. But first Tom called her on
the telephone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Tom!” exclaimed Mary, as soon as she
found who was on the wire, “I was just going to
call you up!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You were?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, it’s awfully important! I want to see
you very much!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, you’ll have that pleasure directly.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Tom, don’t joke about it! It is important.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s the trouble, Mary,” the young inventor
asked, seriously enough now.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll tell you when I see you—soon!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tom told the girl of the proposed trip and
Mary hung up the receiver while Tom wondered
at the note of anxiety in his sweetheart’s
message.</p>

<div><h1 id='ch10'>CHAPTER X<br/> <span class='sub-head'>A QUEER STORY</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>The</span> young inventor was out at the flying
field in his air togs going over every detail of his
machine when Mary Nestor arrived in the auto
driven by a messenger Tom often employed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hello!” called the girl, as she leaped out of
the car. She, too, wore a leather flying suit,
for Tom had told her to put it on.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hello,” responded Tom. “All ready?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. But I want to talk to you, and we
can’t do it very well with the engine going. It
makes such a noise.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This one doesn’t make as much racket as
some do, for I’ve got a muffler on her,” Tom replied.
“But still you can’t exactly carry on a
whispered conversation in the <span class='it'>Hummer</span>.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This conversation is going to be—well
rather private,” returned Mary in a low voice,
with a glance toward the man who had brought
her over in the car.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We might start off, land in some lonely field,
and talk there,” Tom suggested. “I could throttle
down the engine just enough to keep her
turning over, and yet not running enough to
make the plane even taxi.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why can’t you do that here?” asked Mary.
“I want to tell you what I have to say, Tom,
at once, as you might want to act on it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I can have him turn the propellers and
get her started,” answered the youth, with a
glance at his helper. “Then, with the engine
idling, you can tell me the story while he goes
back in the auto.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do that,” suggested the girl. “I want to get
it off my mind.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Accordingly, while Tom vainly wondered
what his sweetheart could have to say to him
of such importance, he took his place in the
forward cockpit, in charge of the control levers,
while the man stationed himself at the propellers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The <span class='it'>Hummer</span> was comparatively easy to
start. After the engine had been turned over
once or twice, with the accompanying coughs
and sighs, it started with a thundering roar that
made the ground throb. Tom let it run until
it was well warmed up. Then, knowing it would
keep going at low speed without moving the
plane, he throttled the gas down, adjusted the
spark, and signed for his helper to leave.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now, Mary, I’m ready to hear your story,”
he said as he walked with his friend a short distance
away from the <span class='it'>Hummer</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s a queer story,” said the girl. “And as
soon as I heard it I started to call you on the
’phone. I was just going to take down the receiver
when you called me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“When did you hear this—whatever it is?”
asked Tom, who was becoming more and more
mystified by Mary’s evident concern.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Just this morning,” she answered. “I was
over in Mansburg doing some early shopping
with Kate Borden. Shopping always makes
me terribly hungry, as it does Kate, so about
noon we went into a small restaurant for lunch.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And I suppose you had mislaid your money
and couldn’t pay, and you had to blush and ask
the manager to trust you, and now you want to
go there in the plane and settle your debts. Is
that it?” asked Tom, with a laugh.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, and if you make any more fun of me
I sha’n’t tell you a thing! So there, Tom
Swift!” and Mary pouted bewitchingly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mercy! I’ll be good!” he promised.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His sense of humor was rudely shaken a moment
later as Mary went on:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“While Kate and I were eating our lunch
three men were eating at the next table—eating
and talking. We didn’t purposely listen—that
is, not until after I heard one of them mention
the Swift Construction Company. But then, as
you can imagine, Tom, I was all ears. I
shamelessly listened after that, and though I
didn’t hear all that was said I caught enough to
know that they were talking about something
like a tidal engine. Is there any such thing,
Tom?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is there, Mary? I should say there is! It’s
one of my latest and best inventions! I believe
I can harness the ocean with it—at least,
a part of the tide. But go on—what did they
say about the tidal engine?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“One of the men seemed angry that you
hadn’t sold it to them. He spoke of Mr.
Damon and said it was too bad—or words to
that effect—that Mr. Damon’s negotiations had
fallen through.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Go on,” urged Tom, as Mary hesitated a
moment. “This is interesting, and it may be
vitally important. Go on!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then they spoke something about mill machinery,”
resumed the girl. “I couldn’t get
that very plainly—I don’t know much about
mechanics—but they spoke of a turbine grinder.
Is that right?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s right!” exclaimed Tom. “But it will
be all wrong if they get on to any of my plans
in that respect. I’m mighty glad you listened
to this talk, Mary! Who were the men—I
mean what did they look like?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll describe them to you as well as I can.
I had never seen any of them before, as far as
I know. The whole trend of the conversation
was to the effect that they had tried unsuccessfully,
through Mr. Damon, to get you or your
father to sell them some or all of the rights in
these inventions. Is that the case?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. Mr. Damon came to me some time
ago—the day he landed on the roof in his little
plane—and wanted me to consider negotiations.
But I sent word by him to these fellows, who
were represented by Mr. Blythe, not to bother,
for I wasn’t in the market.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I didn’t hear Mr. Blythe’s name mentioned,”
said Mary, knitting her forehead into a series
of wrinkles as she tried to recall all the details
of the affair. “But there was some one whose
name began with B—let me see—I wrote it
down.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She fumbled in her pocket and brought out
a slip of paper on which she had written one
word—Blodgett.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s the man, Tom,” she said. “Mr.
Blodgett. One of the three who were talking
near our table remarked: ‘Never mind. I think
Blodgett will fix it.’ Those were the words he
used.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hum,” mused Tom. “Blodgett—and he will
fix it. Fix what, I wonder?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That I can’t say,” answered Mary, for Tom
had spoken aloud. “Right after one of the men
said that, all three went out. I didn’t know
what to do. I kept wishing you had been there.
But I made up my mind I’d tell you about it as
soon as I could.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, Mary. Thanks! I’m glad you did.
It’s all a mystery to me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What do you think it means?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That would be hard to say. I’ll have to
admit I’m a bit worried about it, in view of
several things that have happened at the shop
lately.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Tom do you think there is any danger?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No more than usual. There’s always danger
when you have rivals. But I never heard of this
Blodgett that I know of. As for the other matters:
As I said, Mr. Damon opened the subject
but I told him to head off any visit of the
men to me, for I wouldn’t do business with
them. And from the fact that they haven’t
called on me, I took it that they had dropped
the matter.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It doesn’t seem so, though, does it?” asked
Mary.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I should say not! I don’t like this at all!”
Tom seemed anxious and upset over the matter.
“And what I particularly don’t like is the way
they said Blodgett would fix it. Is that the
word they used?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. It was ‘fix,’ I’m sure of it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Smacks of desperation,” commented Tom.
“I wonder if the owner of the restaurant would
know those men, Mary?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He might.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then I’m going to drop in and have a talk
with him. Give me the address. Oh, I don’t
mean I’m going to drop in off the <span class='it'>Hummer</span> and
let you run the machine alone,” he went on with
a laugh, as he saw Mary’s momentary gasp of
surprise. “I’ll go over and see him to-morrow.
Just now we’ll go for a ride. I need a little
free breathing space in the upper air.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, it’s a wonderful day for a ride, Tom.
And there’s no sign at all of rain.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We need rain, too,” said the young inventor.
“The woods and fields are as dry as tinder. If
a forest fire should start now it would do a lot
of damage. But as long as it hasn’t rained for
some time, we’ll hope it will hold off until we
get back from our spin. Come on—let’s go!”</p>

<div><h1 id='ch11'>CHAPTER XI<br/> <span class='sub-head'>A DOUBLE PERIL</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>With</span> a roar the motor accepted the additional
gas Tom turned into the cylinders, and
a moment later the little plane began to move
over the smooth surface of the field. Gathering
speed, the <span class='it'>Hummer</span> slowly rose as the young
inventor depressed the horizontal rudder, and a
moment later up rose the machine like some
creature of life—up and up toward the clouds.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This is glorious!” cried Mary, thrilled by
the sensation. Riding in a plane was not new
to her, but she never failed to get a sense of
exhilaration out of even a short spin in the air.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not so bad,” answered Tom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>By raising their voices slightly they could
make themselves audible to one another, for, as
the young man had said, there was a silencer, or
muffler, on his engine.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It makes one forget all their trouble,” called
out Mary, as she looked over the side of the
rear cockpit where she sat strapped in and
glanced down at the earth rapidly dropping
away below them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, it does,” assented Tom. “That’s one
reason I wanted to come out to-day—to get rid
of some of the cobwebs.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And are they being brushed away?” asked
Mary.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Almost all gone!” he laughed, as he sent the
<span class='it'>Hummer</span> up at a little steeper angle to gain a
higher altitude more quickly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The two young people gave themselves up to
the thrill and revivifying influence of clear, pure,
sunlit air. Deeply they breathed in of the life-giving
particles, and the cheeks of Tom and
Mary were ruddy with renewed health.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With no special object in view, they spun on
through the air, now going up until they were
above some low-lying clouds and again dipping
down to view with pleasure the contour of some
wonderful, green valley.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Getting tired, Mary?” called Tom, after a
while.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No!” she called back to him. “I could go
on like this forever.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Guess I’ll have to invent some new kind of
machine if you want to do anything like that,”
the youth countered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What do you mean?” challenged Mary.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I mean perpetual motion hasn’t yet been
solved, and I don’t believe it ever will be. As
long as we have gasoline engines they will have
to be given a drink now and then. Which reminds
me that I haven’t enough in the tanks of
the <span class='it'>Hummer</span> to go on for more than a few hours
more.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t want to ride quite that long, of
course! Don’t take any chances. Go back now
if you think anything is going to happen.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nothing is likely to happen!” chuckled the
young inventor. “But I didn’t want you to go
on dreaming that dream of yours about keeping
on forever.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“As if I meant that!” laughed the girl. “Better
turn back now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In a little while,” promised Tom, whose eyes
were just then fixed on some object or some
view just ahead. Mary was quick to notice
his preoccupation as he spoke to her and at
once asked:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is anything the matter, Tom?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Matter? No! Why do you ask?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Because you weren’t thinking of what you
were saying, that’s all. I can always tell. Do
you see anything?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To be perfectly frank, Mary, I do. I see a
cloud of smoke over there in the direction of
Shopton, and when I see smoke I think of fire.
As we recently had a little blaze at one of the
shops, I am a bit anxious to see if this is another.
Of course it will be as well fought with
me away as with me there. But still——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Tom, I see it, too!” cried the girl, as a
little puff of smoke made itself visible near a
wooded part of the country. “Perhaps you’d
better head back that way.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think I will,” decided the pilot.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He moved the steering wheel slightly, banked
the plane a bit, and was off in another direction,
heading directly for the haze of smoke which by
this time had considerably increased in volume.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the time when Tom first saw the smoke
menace he was several miles from it, though the
clear air made the fire seem nearer than it was.
But the <span class='it'>Hummer</span> was a speedy craft, and she
quickly covered the distance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As Tom Swift and Mary Nestor approached
the blaze—for blaze it was, since they could now
notice a redness that betokened flames—they
could see it more plainly, and a sense of relief
came to the young man when he noted that it
was in a spot remote from his shops.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Guess it’s a forest fire, Mary,” Tom observed.
“I thought one would break out soon,
it’s been so dry.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve never seen a forest fire,” she responded.
“It must be very thrilling.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is—and dangerous,” replied Tom. “Well,
you’re going to see one now, for we’re going
right over it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you think it will be safe, Tom?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why not? We’re so high you won’t even
smell the smoke. And as for the heat—well,
they do get pretty warm, but you won’t feel
that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I didn’t mean that so much,” Mary
hastened to say. “But if anything should happen
to the plane——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nothing is going to happen!” laughed Tom.
“I’m going to give you a real view of a forest
fire.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The smoke was rolling up in great clouds now.
But of course the <span class='it'>Hummer</span> was far above the
conflagration. Nor could they hear the crackling
of flames, though this sound was audible to
those fighting the fire.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Men and boys were at work combating the
forest fire. Tom and Mary, from their vantage
point high in the air, could note figures, like
ants or flies, hastening from the surrounding
country toward the scene of the blaze. Some
were hastening up in autos, and others in horse-drawn
vehicles.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What do they do when they fight forest
fires?” asked Mary. “I don’t see any engines.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Engines aren’t of much use—the fire is very
seldom near a water supply,” answered Tom.
“The only thing to do is to take away the stuff
a fire feeds on—dry leaves, sticks, wood or anything
else. Sometimes they do this by digging
up the ground or plowing it in broad, bare strips.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Another way is to make a back fire. That
is, they start some distance off from the blaze
and set fire to a limited area. When this burns
off, and of course it has to be kept under control,
it leaves a black space with no fuel for the
fire to feed upon, and when the original fire gets
to the place it just naturally quits. They use
wet bags, pieces of carpet, anything to beat out
the line of flames when they actually fight the
fire.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It must be hard work,” decided Mary.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is—hot, hard, dirty work. Well, we’ve
got a pretty good view of this fire now, and I
must say I don’t like the looks of it,” remarked
Tom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They were fairly over the burning area now.
Below them were the snapping, leaping flames
and the billowing clouds of smoke. More men
and boys were hastening up to do what they
could to combat the conflagration.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If there should only come a rain now it
would settle the fate of this fire,” remarked
the young inventor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tom looked up and across the sky. It was
blue in nearly every quarter—too blue and
beautiful to suit those who wanted water to
pour down from the heavens.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s a little haze in the west,” remarked
the lad, at length. “It might indicate the coming
of a thunderstorm. That’s what is needed—a
sudden, drenching thunderstorm. A gentle
shower would help, but a regular cloudburst is
needed. Of course, a sizzling rain would put
the fire out in time, but it would take too long.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I do hope it rains!” exclaimed Mary.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tom guided the <span class='it'>Hummer</span> over the very center
of the fire, which seemed to be burning in an
area of forest and brush country several miles
square in extent. Of course in the very center
of the blaze no attempt was being made to fight
it; that would have been too dangerous. It was
on the edges of the ever-increasing circle that
the men and boys were making the attack.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dropping down a bit, so Mary could see better,
Tom pointed out where scores of the fire-fighters
were trying to beat the flames to earth
with long-handled wet bundles of rags, which
from time to time they dipped in brooks and
ponds.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It looks like a losing fight,” sighed the girl.
“Oh, Tom, suppose the fire reaches Shopton!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It won’t with the wind the way it holds
now,” was the reply. “But of course we’d all
feel better with the fire out.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He swung the machine around to take in another
angle of the fire.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Isn’t there anything you can do, Tom?”
asked Mary. “This is terrible!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tom was himself wondering if he could not
be of service instead of merely looking on from
his vantage point of safety in the air. He had
invented an aerial fire-fighting machine, but
this, with its chemical bombs, had been disposed
of, and there was none on hand at Shopton.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I might drop some army bombs down and
try to blow up a big, bare area which would
bring the fire to a stop,” said Tom. “But it
would take some time to get ready for that, and
they may have it out in a few hours. No, I’m
afraid I can’t do anything just now. But we
had better——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tom was about to say he had better start
back with Mary when, with a suddenness that
was startling, the motor of his plane went dead
and the machine began to drop toward the heart
of the forest fire.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Tom!” cried Mary. “Don’t go down so
close! It’s dangerous!”</p>

<div><h1 id='ch12'>CHAPTER XII<br/> <span class='sub-head'>A RING OF FIRE</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Knowing</span> little of the actual working of aeroplanes,
Mary did not realize what the stopping
of the engine meant. She thought Tom had
simply shut it off, as he often did, so the noise
would not interfere with their hearing of what
was going on below.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Go on back up, Tom!” cried the girl. “I
don’t want to go so close.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m afraid there’s no help for it,” stated Tom
grimly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What—what do you mean?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I mean the motor’s stopped. Something
has gone wrong with it. We’re making a forced
landing. Goodness knows what the outcome
will be!” But Tom said the last to himself as
he saw the forest fire seemingly rushing nearer
and nearer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It looked as if he would crash down in the
midst of the burning trees.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If there was only an open place to land it
wouldn’t be so bad!” desperately thought Tom.
“I might be able to make it. But to crash down
into a lot of trees and bushes, and with those
trees and bushes on fire.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Still he kept up a brave front for Mary’s sake.
It was more on her account that Tom was worrying
than on his own. He felt that he could
take a chance and jump at the last minute,
though he carried no parachutes on this plane.
But for Mary to leap was out of the question.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Tom!” she cried, “what is going to happen?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>For a moment the young inventor did not
reply. Then a desperate idea came into his
mind. It was a big chance, but the only one,
and it must be taken.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Not far away was Lake Carlopa, a large sheet
of water on which Tom had tried out many of
his marine ideas. If he could reach that he
might yet save himself and Mary, and, perchance,
even the plane. For though the <span class='it'>Hummer</span>
was not equipped with pontoons for
alighting on water, yet the plunge into that
element would be less damaging to her than a
crash to the ground.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And there’ll be a chance for us, too,” thought
Tom. “She’ll keep afloat on her wings for a
few seconds if she doesn’t go into a nose dive.
Yes, I’ll head for the lake.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Desperately he tried to picture to himself
the grounds surrounding the lake. He was trying
to decide whether there was a field big
enough in which to bring the <span class='it'>Hummer</span> to a regular
gliding landing. If there was, nothing
more would happen than always happened when
an aeroplane landing is made.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But, as Tom recalled it, there were only scattered
farms about the lake, and none of these
was suitable for a landing field. Adjacent to
the lake were picnic grounds, but these were
covered with scattered trees and buildings.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The open lake is my only chance,” decided
Tom. “But can I reach it? That’s the question.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He could see, shimmering in the sunlight
ahead of him, Lake Carlopa. But he also became
aware that his machine was steadily going
down. He tried to figure out whether he could
gain enough horizontal distance in proportion
to his vertical drop to make the lake. And as
he looked at the distance separating him from
the body of water, it was with a sinking sensation
in his heart that he answered himself in
the negative.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It can’t be done!” Tom told himself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This being the case, he must pick out the next
best expedient.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’ve got to crash, and soon,” he reasoned.
“I’d better pick out a big, soft tree. The upper
branches will give a little and bring us up gradually.
A tree’s better than the ground with its
underbrush.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>After her first spasm of terror Mary had become
calm, and was sitting tensely in her seat
waiting for Tom to bring her out of the danger.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was not the first time she and the young
inventor had been in desperate plights, and
always before this Tom had come out ahead of
the game in taking chances with death. Of
course there could be one last time, but Mary
was not thinking of that.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It looked as desperate as this on Earthquake
Island,” she told herself. “Yet we got off,
thanks to Tom.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>All this while the <span class='it'>Hummer</span> had been gliding
down on a long slant. Mary realized, of course,
that the longer and more gradual the slant, or
angle, at which the falling aeroplane approached
the earth, the better chance it had for making a
gentle and safe landing. It is the sudden nose
dives, or tail spins, straight to earth that crash
the planes and kill the pilots.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tom was saving his machine. He would let
it glide swiftly down for a short distance and
then head it up, so it would nose toward the
sky. This would slacken its speed and also
carry it further along.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But it was evident that he could never cross
the wide area of the burning forest and reach
Lake Carlopa. That was out of the question.
The next best thing, as Tom had decided, was
to land in some big tree, the springing branches
of which would act as a cushion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I’ve got to pick out a spot where there
isn’t any fire,” Tom told himself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was, of course, a certain burning area
of the forest fire. Equally of course, there was
not an even number of square miles ablaze.
The fire was irregular in shape, and there were
portions, perhaps a mile in extent each way,
where the flames had not taken hold. Also, because
of the nature of the fuel on which it fed,
the fire advanced irregularly. The line of its
advance was one that curved in and out, so that
there were indentations here and there like the
shore line of the sea, with bays of fire and points
of woodland as yet unburned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To pick out one of these places was Tom’s desire,
and as the aeroplane glided nearer and
nearer to the earth he knew that he must soon
make this decision.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Tom, what are we going to do?” faltered
Mary. The suspense was telling on her. She
could not quite fathom Tom’s object.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’re going to land in that big pine tree,”
he suddenly exclaimed. “Hold your arms over
your face, Mary, so you won’t be scratched.
Look out now—here we go!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As Tom spoke he ducked down behind the
protection cowl of the cockpit in front of him,
having a moment before adjusted the steering
lever so as to glide into the top of an immense
pine tree which stood in the midst of a clump
of other giants of the forest, in a space as yet
untouched by fire.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A moment later the <span class='it'>Hummer</span> crashed—crashed
with a thud, a rending, a crackling, a
splintering and tearing that went to Tom’s
heart, for the plane was almost like a live creature
to him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Even as the plane crashed, Tom knew that he
had made the best landing possible, and that,
for the time at least, he and Mary were safe.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As Tom had anticipated, the spreading
branches of the great pine tree acted as an immense
cushion, and as the <span class='it'>Hummer</span> was a comparatively
small plane, she was buoyed up.
That is, at least long enough to take up the
first shock.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In a few seconds Tom realized that he and
Mary must make a hasty exit from the plane,
for it might slip from its position, and portions
of it drop on them as they slid from their seats.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The poor <span class='it'>Hummer</span> was badly broken. A plane
cannot crash down into a tree and not have
something like that happen. They are not built
for that sort of thing. Tom realized this.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Quick, Mary!” he called. “Unstrap yourself
and I’ll help you climb out and down. I
don’t know how long this plane will stay here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mary had recovered her nerve after the first
shock of the crash and as soon as she realized
that neither of them was hurt beyond more than
bruises and a shaking up.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can get out myself,” she announced, as she
loosed the strap that held her to the cockpit
seat. “And I can climb down out of the tree,
Tom. I’m glad I wore leather knickerbockers
to-day.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So am I,” murmured the young inventor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had loosed himself in his seat and turned
now to help Mary, but of this there was little
need, since she was capable of acting for herself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Several of the branches of the great pine had
been broken off, and the jagged ends were sticking
through the frail wings and the almost as
frail fuselage of the plane. These branches
thus held it in place for a time, but it might
slip down at any moment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How are you making it, Mary?” asked Tom,
as he climbed out on a branch.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m all right,” she said. “This is fun—just
climbing down out of a tree,” and her laugh
showed that her nerves were in good shape, for
which Tom was glad. But then, Mary Nestor
never was the sort of girl to go off in a faint.
She was a brave girl, and that was why Tom
liked her so much.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Together the two made their way down out
of the pine tree, leaving the plane impaled on
the branches over their heads.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Poor <span class='it'>Hummer</span>!” murmured Tom, with more
feeling than he cared to show.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, and poor us, too, perhaps, Tom!” exclaimed
Mary.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, we’re all right!” he exclaimed, as they
reached the ground. “Hardly scratched.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes; but look! The fire! It’s all around
us!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then Tom realized the peril he had all but
forgotten—the peril of flames. As Mary spoke,
the fire, with a sudden burst, leaped a gap
hitherto open and the young people were in the
midst of a raging conflagration—blazing trees
and bushes all about them!</p>

<div><h1 id='ch13'>CHAPTER XIII<br/> <span class='sub-head'>JUST IN TIME</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Mary Nestor</span> had borne up bravely during
the previous trying experiences. But the discovery
that the fire was all about them unnerved
her and filled her with horror.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Tom!” she cried wildly. “We’re doomed!
If we only could have stayed up in the air!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That couldn’t be done,” Tom said grimly.
“We were lucky enough to get down as we did
without being hurt.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I know. But now, Tom, look!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Shuddering, Mary pointed to the encircling
and advancing flames. As yet no clouds of
smoke had blown their way, but it was only a
question of time when the choking, acrid fumes
would almost smother them—blind them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There must be some way out!” muttered
the young inventor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Desperately he scanned the ever-narrowing
circle of fire about him and Mary. What could
be done?</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dry as the woods were for lack of rain, yet
the trees and bushes were green, and burned in
a certain, slow way which alone might prove
the salvation of the two. Had this been fall,
with a mantle of dried leaves on the ground, the
fire would have flashed through as though igniting
gunpowder. As it was, the closing in of the
ring of fire was gradual. This, at least, gave
Tom a chance to search his mind for some way
out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He gave a last despairing look up into the
tree where hung the wreck of the <span class='it'>Hummer</span>.
Truly, if the crash had not destroyed the little
machine beyond hope of repair, the flames
would soon finish her. But Tom was not a
youth to sigh long where it did no good. His
chief concern must now be to save Mary and
himself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’ve got to get out of this!” he cried. “It
will soon be too hot for us.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But can we get out?” Mary’s lips were white,
but she now had control of herself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think so,” Tom replied. “While it looks
as though there was a solid ring of fire about us,
there must be breaks in it here and there—places
where there is comparatively bare ground, big
rocks and so on, that will make a passageway
for us. We must try to find one of these places,
Mary. Now follow, but keep right behind me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tom said this because he wanted to be prepared
to save Mary should a sheet of flame suddenly
spout up in front of them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wait a minute!” cried the girl, as Tom
would have made a dash toward a place where
the smoke and fire seemed less dense and fierce.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s the matter?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Can’t we use these? Wrap them about our
hands and faces in case we get too near the
fire?” asked Mary.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She pointed to two closely woven woolen
blankets that had fallen out of the forward
cockpit of the <span class='it'>Hummer</span>. Tom had stowed these
away to be used on occasional trips when he
went up to such an altitude that it was very
cold, and a blanket about his legs and those of
his passenger might add immeasurably to their
comfort. With the tilting of the plane the
blankets had fallen out shortly after Tom and
Mary had climbed down from the tree.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve often read of persons wrapping their
head in wet blankets to pass through flames,”
said the girl. “And these two are wet, Tom,
look, sopping wet.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Be careful they aren’t soaking in gasoline!”
warned the young man, as Mary picked up the
coverings. “I guess that’s what happened—the
gas tank sprang a leak.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mary’s answer was to raise one edge of a
blanket to her nose.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s water!” she cried. “Not gasoline at
all.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good!” exclaimed Tom. “The radiator
burst, of course, and soaked them. Good
enough, Mary. They will be just the thing to
protect our heads and faces. It’s mighty dangerous
to breathe smoke-laden air. Now we’ll
have a better chance!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He saw to it that Mary had the wetter blanket
of the two, then, with the coverings held in
readiness to use should they approach too near
any flame, the two in such a desperate plight
started in that direction where the flames and
smoke seemed least thick and menacing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>All about the girl and the youth the fire was
raging. There was no difficulty now in hearing
the crackling of the flames or the crash as some
big tree, burned through, fell in the path of the
raging element. Tom listened, thinking he
might hear the shouts of the fire-fighters, and
it was his hope that they might come to the
rescue.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Though there might have been men and boys
near the two imperiled ones, their presence
could not make itself known above the roar and
crackle of the flames.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For a time it seemed as if Tom and Mary
might win through to safety by keeping on in
the direction they first took. They went on for
some distance, now and then stopping to let
what wind there was blow aside a curtain of
choking, blinding smoke.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So far had they progressed that Tom was on
the point of calling: “I think we’re going to
make it, Mary!” when, almost as he spoke, a
curtain of smoke was swept aside and they saw
a line of flame directly in their path over which
it was impossible to leap and through which it
was certain death to pass. Hitherto they had
jumped several little, low lines of fire, which
were low because they had little on which to
feed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But this ahead was part of the main blaze,
and it needed only one glance at it to tell Tom
and his companion that further progress was
blocked in that direction.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No go!” gasped Tom, shutting his eyes a
moment to ease the smart and burn caused by
the smoke.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I should say not!” agreed Mary. “Suppose
you go down that way and try a little to the
left. It doesn’t seem quite so smoky there.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tom looked, and was of the same opinion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Better put the blanket over your head,” he
told the girl. “It seems to be getting hotter
and more sparks are falling. They might catch
in your hair.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The thickly woven blankets, wet as they were
with water from the broken engine radiator,
would prove a good protection against sparks.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Accordingly, Mary threw hers over her head
and Tom did likewise. Then he dashed in the
direction the girl had indicated. But they did
not get as far along this trail as they had on
the other before they were stopped by a wall of
fire.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, dear!” sighed Mary. “What are we
going to do?” She felt helpless and almost hysterical,
but for Tom’s sake, resolutely held herself
in control.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Got to try some other direction!” gasped
Tom, opening the blanket around his face a
little so he could breathe more freely. “We’ve
got to get out!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Apparently, the only other course was to retreat
and try the right, thought Tom, since the
left had proved impracticable. And it was this
decision—the only one possible under the circumstances—which
eventually saved them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>No sooner had Tom taken the lead and gone
a few steps down what seemed a fairly well defined
path than he gave a shout of exultation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What is it?” cried Mary. “Do you see a
way out? I don’t. The smoke seems thicker
than ever!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is,” Tom said. “But we’ll soon be all
right. I know where I am now. I know it by
that big rock. A little way down this path is
a cave. It’s near a brook, and though the brook
may be dried up, the cave will make a place in
which we can be safe from the fire. It’s always
damp in that cave. Besides, there’s nothing in
it to burn. Come on, Mary!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are you sure you’re right, Tom? It looks
worse than ever in that direction!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I know where I am now,” he replied.
“We’ll soon be all right!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Though Tom spoke positively, Mary had her
doubts, especially as it got hotter and smokier
as they went down the path and the crackle of
the flames was louder.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But once Tom Swift had been in a certain
place, he never forgot it. He had an excellent
sense of direction, and his memory had not
played him false on this occasion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Running along the edge of a tract of brambles
and briars that were beginning to burn fiercely
and looking back to see that Mary was following,
Tom led the way down a little gulch. He
seemed to be going right into the heart of the
flames, and had Mary not known him as well
as she did she might have feared to follow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But she kept on, and a little later Tom came
to a stop at the edge of a black, yawning hole
in the side of a hill.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Here’s the place!” he cried. “And there’s
the brook! Some water in it, too, which is the
best luck yet. We’ll have time to wet the blankets
and get a drink! My mouth is parched!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mary, too, suffered from thirst, but she had
made up her mind not to say anything about it
for the present. Now, however, that there was
a chance to get a drink, the thirst seemed to
rush upon her irresistibly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The fire had not yet reached the little gully,
but the trees and bushes on the top of the ridge
beneath which extended the cave were starting
to burn.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’ll have a few seconds,” Tom remarked.
“Come on down to the brook.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>In spring, following the rains and the melting
of snow, the brook was of goodly size. Now it
was much smaller, though Tom knew it widened
and deepened about half a mile farther down.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The two laved their hands and faces in the
cooling water, drank copiously of it, and then
soaked their blankets well. Then, as a fiercer
crackling of flames than any yet warned them
that the fire was advancing, Tom cried:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come on!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Up from the edge of the brook they ran and
into the cool, dark and friendly shelter of the
cave. They reached it only just in time, for
they were no sooner inside than a shower of
sparks and burning brands, falling into some
dry sticks, leaves and grass near the mouth of
the cavern, sent a sheet of flame directly across
it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now let the fire burn itself out—and it won’t
take long at this rate!” cried Tom, as he and
Mary stood in comparative safety, free from the
menace of fire and out of that blinding, choking
smoke.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then, to Tom’s surprise, Mary burst out crying.</p>

<div><h1 id='ch14'>CHAPTER XIV<br/> <span class='sub-head'>A QUEER ATTACK</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>The</span> young inventor, not much accustomed to
tears, thought at first that Mary had been hurt
in some way, perhaps burned by a flying brand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What is it? Tell me,” he urged, taking her
in his arms as they stood in the cool darkness
and safety of the cave.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m—I’m all right!” gasped Mary, looking
up at him as well as she could in the gloom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right? Then, why are you crying?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, it’s because—because I’m so glad we’re—we’re
here—safe!” sobbed the girl.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh!” exclaimed Tom, but there was a great
deal of meaning in that one word. “Yes, I
guess we’re all right,” he agreed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He looked out of the cave. In front of it and
on either side the fire was burning fiercely. Another
few seconds and neither he nor Mary
would have been able to get through that fierce,
hot barrier. But the flames could not eat their
way into the cavern.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then, as he and the girl stood there, thankfulness
in their hearts that they had thus come
safely through two grave dangers, there suddenly
sounded a deep, booming, vibrating sound
that seemed to shake the earth about them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dynamite!” cried Tom. “They’ve brought
up explosives and are blowing up patches to
stop the flames. A good idea!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, that isn’t dynamite,” said Mary. “Don’t
you know thunder when you hear it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thunder?” cried Tom Swift.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. It’s thundering! Don’t you remember,
we saw signs of a storm coming up in the
west just before the aeroplane went dead?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s right. If it is thunder——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A booming crash interrupted him. There
was no doubt of it, a heavy storm was pending.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The rain will put out the forest fire,” concluded
Tom. “Then we can get out of here and
back home.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Home seems a long way off,” sighed Mary.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We can make it pretty quickly by going
down the brook,” suggested Tom. “The brook
always rises a short time after even a little rain,
for all the water in this section drains into it.
I know where there’s a boat hidden in the
bushes not far from here, and we can paddle
down in that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It sounds enticing,” returned Mary. “Oh, I
look a fright, don’t I?” she asked, with a nervous
giggle. Having been in the cave a little while,
their eyes were more accustomed to the gloom
and they could see better.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You do not!” emphatically cried Tom,
which, of course, was the right answer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It has been a wonderful experience,” she
went on slowly. “Not that I would care to repeat
it—Oh, Tom!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She suddenly gave a gasp of fear and covered
her eyes with her hands as a blinding flash of
lightning seemed actually to shoot through the
cavern. It was followed a second later by a
crash of thunder which made even Tom Swift,
used as he was to experimenting with big guns,
jump.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Here comes the rain!” he cried.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At that moment the storm broke with almost
tropical fury, the big drops pelting down like
hail on the burning trees, bushes and such dry
leaves as had accumulated from the previous
fall.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This will douse the blaze,” went on the
young inventor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Certainly, no forest fire could continue in the
face of such odds as a violent rain storm—and
this storm was violent. Seldom had Tom seen
it rain so hard. He and Mary stood in the entrance
to the cave and watched the drops pelt
down. They could observe the fire in front of
them die away, the blaze flickering out and then
the smoke ceasing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I guess those fire-fighters are glad of this!”
observed Tom, as he remembered the hardworking
men and boys.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Indeed, yes,” agreed Mary.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For an hour or more the downpour continued,
and every vestige of the forest fire was extinguished
when at last the muttering of the
thunder died away and the fierce glow of the
lightning faded from the blackened clouds.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tom stepped outside the cave and looked
about him. In the distance he could hear the
loud murmuring of the brook, now turned into
a good-sized stream.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come on, Mary,” he called. “It’s all over.
We might as well start. Your mother may be
worried about you. I’ll find that boat and
we’ll soon be in Shopton.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I do wish I had a comb or something!”
exclaimed the girl as she emerged from the cavern,
trying to pin her hair back to keep it out
of her eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You look fine!” declared Tom, and he really
meant it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can’t help it, anyhow,” Mary said, smiling
slightly. “Thanks, Tom.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The boat was found where Tom knew it to be
hidden—he had used it on some of his excursions
with Ned—and soon he and his companion
were riding in comparative comfort down the
swift little stream. They passed through a
region where the forest fire had eaten its devastating
way, but now the danger was over, the
rain having soaked and drenched the woods.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In due time Tom and his companion reached
the outskirts of Shopton, and then, knowing
Mary would like a little privacy, he went to the
nearest telephone and called a taxicab from the
town garage. It came out to get him and Mary,
and a little later she was safe at home.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Mary! I’ve been so worried about you!”
cried Mrs. Nestor. “Where have you been?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, aeroplaning, falling, climbing out of
trees, forest-firing, thunder and lightning, boating
and floating—those are just a few of our
activities this afternoon,” replied Mary, with
a little excited laugh.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What does she mean, Tom?” asked the bewildered
lady.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Those are some of the things that happened
to us,” the young inventor said. “It isn’t a bit
exaggerated. I suppose you heard about the
forest fire?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes; and we were much worried for those in
its path. But Mr. Nestor said it wouldn’t come
this way.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, it was far enough off from you,” agreed
Tom. “And it’s all over now. Well, I think
I’ll get back. I took this afternoon off as a
sort of rest and mental relaxation—and I got
it!” he chuckled grimly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How is Mr. Newton’s case coming on, Tom?”
asked Mrs. Nestor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We thought very well, but something curious
turned up a few days ago,” answered the young
inventor, but not going into details. “Mr.
Plum and Mr. Newton are out of town now,
running down some evidence.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>At that moment the telephone rang, and Mr.
Nestor, answering it, exclaimed:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tom Swift? Yes, he’s here. Wait a minute
and I’ll let you talk to him. It’s for you,
Tom,” he said, as he handed him the receiver.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hello!” called Tom into the instrument.
Then he recognized his father’s voice and was
aware at once that something had happened.
“What’s that?” he cried. “An attack on you
and Mrs. Baggert? Are you hurt? I’ll be
right over! Send Ned with the runabout! Yes,
I’ll come right away!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was an anxious look on his face as he
hung up the receiver and turned to his friends.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What is it?” asked Mary. “Has anything
happened?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Lots, apparently,” answered Tom, with a
grim smile. “Just a little while ago, while my
father was alone, working in our office, he
was mysteriously attacked and momentarily
knocked senseless. Mrs. Baggert, too, was
knocked down; and when Eradicate came to
help he was savagely set upon—not that it
would take much to knock out the poor old
fellow.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who did it?” cried Mr. Nestor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is your father much hurt?” asked Mary.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dad doesn’t know who did it,” Tom answered.
“He isn’t much hurt, I’m glad to say,
or he wouldn’t have been able to telephone. I
didn’t get a chance to ask him how Mrs. Baggert
and Rad were, but I don’t believe they’re in a
serious condition or he would have told me. It’s
the mysteriousness of the attack and what it
may mean that alarms my father and, naturally,
me also.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you want me to go back with you, Tom?”
asked Mr. Nestor. “I may be able to help
you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thank you, but I guess the worst is over.
I’ll telephone back and let you know how matters
stand as soon as I find out myself. Ned
ought to be here in a little while if he has luck.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You mean if he isn’t smashed up hurrying
here,” said Mary.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Something like that—yes,” Tom answered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Certainly, Ned got out of the electric runabout
about all it was capable of, for soon after
Mr. Swift had telephoned the news of the mysterious
attack the honk of the machine was
heard out front. Bidding his friends good-bye,
the young inventor was rushed to the scene of
the latest outrage on the part of his enemies.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That it was the work of some enemy, or enemies,
Tom did not for an instant doubt. It
was not the first time those jealous of his success
had tried to wrest from him by unfair
means the fruits of his talents and toils.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s it all about, Ned?” he asked his manager,
as he was rushed along in the electric car.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t know, Tom,” was the answer. “I had
gone over to the bank, and I was delayed a little
while. As a matter of fact, I stopped to hear
some reports about the forest fire, for I was anxious
about you.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“When I got back I found the office in confusion,
and Eradicate, staggering about with a
badly cut head, was telling some story about a
big red-haired man who had burst in on your
father and had tried to take some papers away
from him. Mrs. Baggert, it seems, had come
over to the office to bring your father a glass
of milk which she thought he ought to have, and
she tried to stop the attack. But the rascal
went for her, too.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“As soon as I got in your father, having in
the meanwhile located you at Mary’s house,
sent me over to get you. That’s all I know
about it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is dad all right?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes—nothing serious. Though he’s greatly
upset, and that isn’t any too good for him. But
he got only a slight blow on the head.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And a man with red hair did it,” mused
Tom. “Red hair! I don’t know anybody with
red hair who would be as desperate as all that.
This is getting mysterious!”</p>

<div><h1 id='ch15'>CHAPTER XV<br/> <span class='sub-head'>THE TRAP</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>The</span> young inventor, followed by his manager
and chum, hurried into the house.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tom found Dr. Clayton putting the finishing
touches to the dressing on a scalp wound Eradicate
had sustained in the encounter. In one
corner of the room Mrs. Baggert, a bandage
around one hand, was endeavoring to get Mr.
Swift to drink something from a cup.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I tell you I’m all right,” insisted the old inventor.
“I don’t need any catnip tea, my dear
Mrs. Baggert!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But it will be good for your nerves. Won’t
it, doctor?” asked the solicitous housekeeper.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I guess it won’t do him any harm,” was the
noncommittal answer. “There, Rad, now you’ll
be all right,” he added. “You aren’t as badly
hurt as you thought.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Say, this looks like a first-line dressing station!”
exclaimed Tom, for a glance showed him
that the situation was not as desperate as it had
at first seemed. No one was seriously hurt.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Three casualties, but they can all get back
on the firing line soon,” announced Dr. Clayton,
with a smile.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are you able to talk to me about it, Dad?”
asked Tom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He should be in bed and taking hot catnip
tea!” insisted Mrs. Baggert.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You ought to be in bed yourself, Mrs. Baggert!”
returned Mr. Swift in kindly tones.
“That wound in your hand——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pshaw! A mere scratch. I’ve done worse
to myself lots of times with a darning needle!”
she replied. “And I do wish you’d take this
catnip tea!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m not a baby!” laughed Mr. Swift. “But,
give it here!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had decided that this was the best way of
getting rid of the insistent and troubled housekeeper.
He drank the concoction, making
rather a wry face over it, and then Mrs. Baggert,
satisfied, went out of the room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now let’s have the story,” suggested Tom.
“Start at the beginning. Is Rad able to tell his
part in it?” he inquired, as he placed a chair
for the aged colored man.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I shore is!” was the emphatic answer. “An’
ef dat red-haired rascal comes in yeah now
I’ll lambaste him a good one—dat’s whut I
will!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Better go easy, Rad,” advised the doctor,
who was putting away the materials he had
been using.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was this way, Tom—” said his father, and
then, noticing the rather disheveled condition of
his son, he exclaimed: “Were you attacked
also?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No. I had a little trouble with the plane
and had to sprint with a forest fire,” was the
easy answer. “I’m all right. Go on.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thereupon Mr. Swift related that he had
been at work in a room opening out of Tom’s
main office on some figures Tom had asked him
to verify when a man suddenly entered and
without warning reached over the desk as if to
grab the papers on which Mr. Swift was working.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I gave a yell and leaped at him,” said the
aged inventor, “but he struck me with something
in his hand. I got dizzy and sank back in
my chair. Just then Eradicate, who was out
in the hall, rushed in and the man turned on
him, giving poor Rad a blow that knocked him
down.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What happened after that I don’t know, except
that I saw, in a daze, Mrs. Baggert enter
the room and the man spring at her. Then I
must have fainted. When I came to myself I
was being looked after by Dr. Clayton. But
I’m all right now. We must get after this rascal,
Tom.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Certainly we will, Dad. But who was he?
What does he look like? A red-haired man has
been mentioned.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, Tom, this fellow had closely-cropped
red hair. I have never seen him before that I
know of.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Had you, Rad?” asked the youth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, Massa Tom. I was sweepin’ out in de
hall an’ I had my back to de do’. I didn’t see
de fellah go in. But I heard yo’ pa yell, den I
bust in.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What happened then?” Tom wanted to
know, while Ned made notes in shorthand of the
answers, so he and Tom could go over it later.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, de mostest whut happen is dat me an’
dat fellah come togetha,” explained Rad. “I
went fo’ to hit him, but he done hit me fust!
Golly, ef dey was ebber a time when I done wish
fo’ dat giant, it was den!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do all the descriptions of this man tally?”
asked Tom. “I mean does Mrs. Baggert also
say he was a stranger with red hair?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” answered Mr. Swift. “I questioned
her about that before you got here. The fellow
surely had red hair cut close to his head.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did he get away with anything?” asked Tom
quickly. “I mean any of our plans? What
papers did you have out on the desk when he
burst in on you. Dad?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They were the plans of both the tidal engine
and the mill machinery that I was glancing
over, you asked me to verify your figures, you
know,” was the answer. “But he didn’t get
any.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The excitement was extreme while it lasted,
but it was over now. Inquiries developed the
fact that none of the employees in the office had
seen the mysterious red-haired stranger enter
or leave.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had been evolved out of thin air, it seemed,
and had vanished into the same element. That
he had had his trouble for his pains was evident,
for a careful check-up showed that none of the
tidal engine papers was missing, nor had any of
the mill machinery plans been taken from Mr.
Swift.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How about my chest of stuff?” asked Tom
anxiously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s all right,” his father informed him. “I
looked at that as soon as I felt able. It’s locked
and still in place.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good!” cried Tom. “And now we must get
busy and solve this mystery.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Making sure that his father, Rad and Mrs.
Baggert were really in no danger, Tom took a
bath to remove some of the grime of his recent
experiences and then sent a couple of his men
over to the pine tree in which the <span class='it'>Hummer</span> had
lodged.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m afraid the plane’s a goner,” Tom said.
“But maybe you can save part of her. The engine
ought to be good, anyhow.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>This having been done, and as it was now
late in the day, Tom closed the office, first, however,
arranging to have Koku take up his sleeping
quarters there to be on guard every night.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If the red-haired chap returns, he’ll meet
with a different reception this time,” Tom said
to Ned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He and Ned made a careful check-up on all
the incidents connected with the attempted robbery
and assault. They looked about the place
for clews, but found none of any moment. Nor
could any one be found who had seen the scoundrel
make his way to Mr. Swift’s room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The young inventor had not forgotten what
Mary had told him about the conversation in
the restaurant, and he called up the proprietor
on the telephone. But that individual could
give him no information concerning the fellows
who had had their meal there.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was natural that Tom’s mind should jump
to the latest acquisition to his working force—the
man Barsky. Somewhat suspicious of him
from the first, and these suspicions added to by
his father’s ominous shake of the head and his
expressed doubts of the Russian, Tom decided
to keep an eye on the fellow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was almost closing time in the shops when
Dr. Clayton had gone, leaving all his patients
in good shape, and when Tom and Ned had
been informed as to the main points in the matter.
With his suspicions fermenting, Tom hurried
over to the pattern shop.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was with mingled feelings that he saw
Barsky hard at work on certain important
models. Tom passed the fellow and spoke to
him, saying casually:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It will soon be quitting time.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Eet matters not to me—hours,” replied the
man in his strong accent. “When I work I
think not of time. I am of much interest in my
profession.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, it’s a good thing to be so interested,”
returned Tom dryly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He passed on, but took a position where he
could watch the man without himself being observed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was hot in the workshop. Beads of perspiration
came out on Barsky’s forehead, and
as he mopped them away with a big, blue handkerchief,
Tom, from his hiding place, saw something
that made him exclaim:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The fellow’s wearing a wig!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Wild ideas ran through Tom Swift’s mind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll set a trap for him,” he decided.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The quitting whistle blew. True to his statement,
the Russian worked on, though other men
laid aside their tools. Tom remained in his
hiding place, but it was now getting dark in
the shop and he could see little.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was not until shortly before noon the following
day that Tom had a chance to put into
operation his plan of laying a trap for Barsky.
In the meanwhile nothing new had developed
in the matter of discovering the red-haired man.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Carrying out his plan, Tom went to a small
room in the rear of his office where he sometimes
carried out delicate experiments. From there
he caused to be sent to the suspect a message
that he was wanted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The approach to this little room was along a
narrow corridor where there was not room for
two to pass. When Tom heard Barsky approaching
in answer to the summons, the young
inventor hurried out, timing himself to meet
the Russian in the corridor. To keep the matter
secret, Tom had arranged to be alone in this
part of the building.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah, you sent for me, Mr. Swift?” asked the
man. “Eet is a plaisair for to come to so distinguished
an inventor.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thus the man exclaimed as he saw Tom coming
toward him out of the little room. But
Tom gave the fellow no chance to do anything,
had such been his intention.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Brushing up against the suspect, as though to
pass him in the narrow corridor, Tom raised
his hand and brushed the big mop of black hair
on Barsky’s head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A moment later the wig of hair came off and
with it the bushy black beard that all but hid
the fellow’s face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah, I thought so!” cried Tom, as he saw
closely-cropped red hair, heretofore hidden by
the wig. “You’re a prison bird all right, Barsky—or
whatever your name is. I’ve found you
out!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>For a moment the man was so taken by surprise
that he could only stand with open mouth,
gasping.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then, suddenly, rage seemed to take possession
of the red-haired rascal—the same sort of
rage that must have actuated him in his attack
on Mr. Swift, Eradicate and Mrs. Baggert. Before
he could speak, however, Tom cried:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re through here, you dirty scoundrel!
Get your time and clear out! And don’t think
you’re going to have it end there. I’m going
to have you arrested!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, you are, eh?” sneered the man, and,
realizing that his disguise had been effectually
penetrated, all trace of his pretended Russian
accent disappeared. He spoke ordinary English.
“So you think you’ve found me out, do you?
Well, you’ve got another guess coming, Tom
Swift! I’m not half through with you!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You mean I’m not through with you!” replied
Tom. “You’re an imposter! I have been
suspecting you for some time, and my father
has from the first. Now we’ll have a settlement!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But first I’ll settle with you!” cried the fellow,
whose rage was on the increase. His lips
closed tightly and he clenched his hands. These
should have been warning signs to Tom, but
they were not.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A moment later, kicking aside the wig and
false beard, the fellow made a jump for the
young inventor. Whether he held concealed in
his hand some object like a black-jack, was
never found out. But the fellow gave Tom
such a blow on the head that the young inventor
crumpled up and went down in a heap.
Blackness closed over him and in his ears a multitude
of bells seemed to ring.</p>

<div><h1 id='ch16'>CHAPTER XVI<br/> <span class='sub-head'>BOUND IN DARKNESS</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Ned Newton</span> was rather puzzled over Tom’s
long absence from the office. The day had
passed and the young inventor had been at his
usual desk for only a brief period in the morning.
He had told Ned he was going into the
little testing room and would soon be back.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ned knew that Tom did not like to be disturbed
when conducting experiments and tests
in this “cubby-hole,” as it was called, for it was
made small purposely to avoid air drafts and
vibrations. So when noon came and Tom did
not appear for dinner, nothing much was
thought of it, as he frequently missed a meal.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But this time I have chicken and dumplings,”
complained Mrs. Baggert. “And Tom
is so fond of them!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He doesn’t know what he’s missing,” commented
Ned, who always ate lunch with the
Swifts, as time was saved by not going to his
own home.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll save him some,” remarked the kind-hearted
housekeeper.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Noon passed, and the afternoon was waning
when a message came over the telephone that
needed Tom’s personal attention. He had left
orders that, no matter what he was doing, he
should be summoned when this call came in.
So Ned, believing his friend was in the little experiment
room, hastened there, leaving Mr.
Newton, who was back in Shopton, looking
white and worried, to hold the wire.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Tom was not in the little room. Nor
was he in the corridor where Barsky, in a fit of
rage at being discovered, had knocked the
young inventor senseless.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hum, this is queer,” mused Ned. But no
suspicion as yet entered his head. “He must
have gone back to the office by the outside way,”
for this was possible.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hurrying back to the main room Ned did not
meet his chum. Then began a hurried search
for the missing youth, still with no thought that
anything was wrong. It was merely believed
that he had left the experiment room to go to
some other part of the works, as he often
did. Accordingly, the intercommunication telephone
system was worked to the limit. But
from the foreman of each department came the
reply:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mr. Swift isn’t here, nor has he been here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>From the pattern room came the report:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mr. Swift not here, but he ought to come
here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why?” asked Ned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Because,” replied the foreman, “that new
Russian workman he hired has gone away and
left a valuable pattern half glued. It will be
ruined if it isn’t finished and placed in the vise
to set. But none of the men knows anything
about it, and I don’t either. Mr. Swift gave
special orders that Barsky was to be allowed to
work in his own way on that train-stop matter,
and we don’t like to interfere. But I know
enough about pattern making to feel sure this
one will be spoiled if it isn’t finished soon.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll see if I can find Mr. Swift and send him
to you,” promised Ned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Tom could not be found in any of the
shop departments, nor was he in his rooms at
home. He had not been seen there since early
morning, Mrs. Baggert stated.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Still no alarm was felt. Often in the excitement
of following up a new idea or completing
an invention on which he had been working a
long time, Tom would slip off by himself, either
to be alone with his thoughts or to try out something
that had occurred to him. And often he
said nothing to any one of his intention.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s probably what he’s done now,” remarked
Ned, and so little was thought of the
matter that Mr. Swift was not informed, for it
did not occur to any one but that Tom would
come back by evening.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He might be over at Mary Nestor’s house,”
suggested Mr. Newton, when the person who
had called Tom on the telephone had been told
to ring up later in the day.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s so,” agreed the young manager. “It’s
the most likely place to find him. I should
have thought of that before.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Mary also answered in the negative.
Tom was not there.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is anything the matter?” she asked, influenced
to do so perhaps by an anxious note in
Ned’s voice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, no; nothing wrong,” he said. “It’s just
an important message for him. He’ll be around
soon, I guess.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Tom Swift was far from “being around.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ten thousand years seemed to pass while the
young inventor lay in a fog of incoherence. At
least, it appeared to Tom to be ten thousand
years—perhaps longer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Slowly he opened his eyes, but the darkness
about him was so intense that he thought it was
still an effect of the cowardly blow, which he
now remembered. But in a moment he knew
that his eyes were open and that he was staring
out of them, but without seeing anything.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The blackness was profound—like a piece of
black velvet wrapped about him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And then, as he tried to move and found that
he could not, Tom knew that he was bound—bound
with ropes and in a dark and strange
place.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I surely am up against it!” he muttered.</p>

<div><h1 id='ch17'>CHAPTER XVII<br/> <span class='sub-head'>OUT OF THE CISTERN</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='sc'>Where</span> am I and what happened?” Tom
asked himself. Rather futile and hackneyed
questions, but they were just the points Tom
desired to be informed about.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Much easier it was to reconstruct what had
happened than it was to answer the first question
as to where he was. Beyond the fact that
he was in some dark place—very dark—and
that it was damp and noisome, Tom could not
imagine where he had been taken.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was coming back to him now, and he
helped his dazed brain to clear by talking aloud
to himself. He realized that he was alone—or
so he judged—for his first exclamation after recovering
consciousness had brought forth no
answer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let’s see now,” mused the youth. “I
knocked off Barsky’s wig and false beard and
saw that he had close-cropped red hair. This
makes him, beyond doubt, the scoundrel who
attacked dad and the others. It also makes me
think this Barsky is a prison bird, or has been
at one time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He got mad when I fired him, and he came
at me. I remember that, but it’s the last thing
I do remember. He must have given me a
crack on the head with a black-jack and
knocked me out. It happened in the little passage
near the experiment room, and no one saw
it. Then he must have tied me up and carried
me here—wherever this is.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And Tom would have given a goodly sum,
just then, to know exactly where he was. It did
not seem possible that Barsky could have packed
him into an automobile and carried him far
away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He would have been seen by some one in the
office or the shops,” reasoned Tom. “Therefore
I must be hidden in some place not very
far from my own home or the office. Now
where is there a locality like this around our
shops?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Having thus considerably narrowed the inquiry,
Tom further simplified it by a process of
elimination. He sensed that he was in some
place below the level of the ground. The close,
stuffy atmosphere of his prison proved that.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And it’s damp, too,” mused Tom. “It has
held water! Ah, I have it—the old cistern under
the first shop we built!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>When the Swift Construction Company was
first started it was in a modest way, with only
a small shop. Beneath this Mr. Swift had had
built a large cistern for the storage of rain water,
which, because of its softness, or non-chemical
quality, was needed in his experiments. Later,
when the business grew and the little old shop
was abandoned, the cistern was emptied and
closed, a larger storage tank being built in another
place.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Entrance to the abandoned cistern could be
gained by a trap door in the floor of the shop,
but as Tom remembered there was no ladder
in the reservoir.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Barsky must have lowered me in here with
a rope,” thought Tom. “Then he simply
dropped the cover on and ran away. It was
clever of him. Now he has time to work some
of his plans, I suppose. This is all a deep-laid
plot, and it’s been in the making some time. I
wish I had taken dad’s advice and never hired
that fellow! However, it’s too late to think
about that now! I must get myself out of here
and stop him—that is, if it isn’t too late!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tom managed to squirm to a sitting position.
This made him feel better, but it sent the blood
again rushing into his sore head, and for a moment
or two he felt dizzy and sick. This passed,
however, and he began to reason matters out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I could shout my lungs out,” reasoned Tom,
“and no one would hear me. But, wait! I remember
something. The tunnel! It’s all right!
I can get out if I can free myself!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>With the further clearing of his brain it occurred
to Tom that some years before he and
his father had dug a tunnel, leading from a
distant hillside into the cistern. The tunnel
passed beneath the foundations of the old shop
and the passage was used to conduct some experiments
in the action of air currents. Aeroplane
models, as one knows, are tested in what
is called a wind tunnel, and the Swift underground
tunnel was one of the first of these ever
made. It had not been used for a long time,
however, and the end, opening under the hill,
had been boarded up.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But if I can get loose I can walk along the
tunnel and I guess I can manage to kick down
those boards,” thought Tom. “However, the
question is, can I get loose?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>At first it seemed that this must be answered
in the negative. So firmly had Barsky made
the bonds that Tom tugged and strained for
some time, to his no small discomfort, without
any effect.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At last, however, he felt the ropes around his
hands, which had been tied behind his back,
giving a little. This encouraged him, and, gritting
his teeth to keep back involuntary exclamations
of pain, he strained harder. It was out
of his power to break them, but the ropes
stretched a little, and at last, after hard work,
he managed to get his hands free.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But such was the cruel force with which the
cords had been knotted and so long had they
been on the captive’s wrists that, even though
his hands were now free, he had little use of
them. They were numb and helpless. Like
limbs “asleep” and, as Tom said afterward, they
felt as big as sofa cushions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They soon, however, began to tingle as the
blood resumed its circulation, and with the sensation
of pins and needles pricking his fingers,
Tom began to feel that he could use his hands.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This he did in loosening the cords around his
feet, and in a few minutes more he was able to
stand up, free to move about and take up the
matter of getting out of the cistern.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was as dark as a pocket in there, and Tom
wished he had with him a small electric flashlight.
Almost always he carried one, but this
time, just when it was most needed, he was without
it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I guess I can go by feeling,” he told himself.
“This cistern isn’t so immense. It’s circular,
and no matter where I start on the wall
I’m bound to come to the tunnel opening some
time or other. I guess it’s a mighty good
thing,” grimly thought Tom, “that there’s no
water in this place. No thanks to Barsky, I
guess, that there isn’t. He’d have dropped me
in just the same, I believe.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tom, with outstretched hands, began to grope
his way about in the dark cistern. He knew
there were no holes in the floor, so he did not
fear a fall, and there was nothing with which
he could collide. From the length of time it
took him to reach the wall, Tom judged that he
had been lying about in the center of the old
water-container. This proved his theory that
Barsky had lowered him into it from the trap
door above.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Once Tom was in contact with the circular
wall of the cistern, it was an easy matter to follow
it around until he came to the tunnel
opening.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This way out!” exclaimed the young inventor
grimly. “I wonder what time it is and how
long I’ve been in here. Maybe they’re looking
for me up above. And yet, perhaps they think
I’m just off on one of my trips.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tom started into the black tunnel. It had
been several years since it had been put to use,
and the youth had not entered it during all that
time. Consequently he proceeded a bit cautiously,
for he did not know but what there
might be holes here and there in the floor of it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After about five minutes of careful progress
Tom felt on his face a cool current of air.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m coming to the boarded-up opening!” he
exclaimed exultingly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The boards did not fit tightly, and through
one of the larger cracks Tom caught a glint of
light.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But it’s starlight!” he cried. “It’s night!
I must have been in that cistern all day—maybe
two days! Though I guess not two days or I’d
feel hungrier and thirstier than I am.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Pushing on the boards, Tom felt them give
a little, and he knew they must have rotted
away from contact with the damp earth. He
pushed harder and kicked on them, thus knocking
down the barrier.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In rushed the glorious fresh air, and the
young inventor saw that he was looking out on
a field some distance away from his home. It
was night, and the stars were glittering. Also,
not far away from the tunnel entrance another
light was gleaming. It was the light of a lantern
set on the ground.</p>

<p class='pindent'>By the gleam of the lantern on the ground
Tom could see a figure moving about and, seemingly,
digging in the earth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This is queer,” mused the lad. “I wonder
who that is? If it’s Barsky, maybe he’s digging
to try to get at some of my secrets. Or
maybe he thinks I’m dead and he’s making a
grave for me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tom dismissed this gruesome thought with a
laugh, and walked forward a few paces, the better
to see who was doing that queer midnight
digging by lantern light.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Some noise Tom made attracted the notice
of the digger. He looked toward the tunnel
opening, and then Tom exclaimed:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good night! It’s Rad!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>At that moment, the colored man, with a cry
of fear, made a jump, knocking over and extinguishing
the lantern while he shouted:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“De ghost! De ghost! I’s a daid darkey!
I’s done seen a h’ant! Oh, lawzy, lawzy! De
ghost am after me!”</p>

<div><h1 id='ch18'>CHAPTER XVIII<br/> <span class='sub-head'>TWO DISAPPEARANCES</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Despite</span> the fact that he was tired, upset in
his mind and that his head was beginning to
ache again, Tom Swift could not help laughing
at the fright shown by Eradicate as the colored
man made the best time possible away from the
“ghost.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come back here, Rad! Come back! Nothing’s
going to hurt you!” cried Tom, running
down toward the upset lantern. “I’m no ghost!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hearing his master’s voice, the colored man
halted. Still not altogether convinced, he stood
looking back and ready to run, as he asked:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Am dat—am dat you, Massa Tom?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course it is, Rad! Who else would it be?
I came out of the old cistern.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, den you’s daid! You shore am daid an’
it’s yo’ h’ant I sees!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Eradicate would have run away again, but
Tom called more sternly:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wait a minute! Don’t be foolish! Of
course I’m not dead, though I’m in pretty bad
shape after what that scoundrel Barsky did to
me. Have they been looking for me, Rad?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, Massa Tom—dat is, ef you <span class='it'>is</span> Massa
Tom,” he added, as a qualifying remark. “Dey
has been done lookin’ fo’ you. But we done
thought you gone off to see Massa Damon,
maybe, and maybe you done took dat Barsky
with you, ’case he’s done gone, too!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I reckon he’s gone all right!” muttered
Tom. “But I’ve been around here all the while,
Rad. Barsky knocked me senseless, bound me,
and dropped me into the cistern under the old
shop. I just managed to get out through the
tunnel.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, sah, Massa Tom. I’s mighty glad
you done got out. But is you suah—is you
quite suah—Massa Tom, dat you isn’t a ghost?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course I’m sure!” laughed the young
man. “What makes you think I’m a ghost?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ’Case as how you’s all white like.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then Tom looked down at his clothes and
saw that he was covered with a white powdery
substance which must, in the darkness, have
given him a weird appearance, especially to the
superstitious colored man.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s chalk dust, or something like that,” said
Tom, as he slapped at his coat sleeves and
trouser legs, thereby setting free a haze of white,
powdery stuff. “I remember now that there
are soft white rocks in the earth of the cistern
and the tunnel. I must have brushed off a lot
of the stuff on my clothes as I came along. No
wonder you took me for a ghost.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, sah, dat’s jest whut you done look like,”
said Eradicate.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, you know now that I’m no ghost, don’t
you?” asked Tom, as he continued to get rid of
the white dust on his clothes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Um—yes, sah, I done reckon so,” answered
the colored man, a bit doubtfully. “Anyhow,
you <span class='it'>says</span> so, Massa Tom, an’ whut you says
mus’ be so.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is in this case, anyhow,” replied the youth.
“But it isn’t Barsky’s fault that I’m not a ghost.
Now we’ll go back to the house and relieve their
anxiety, for I suppose they must have been a
little anxious about me, Rad.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, yes, sah, dey has done been huntin’ all
ober fo’ you,” was the answer. “Yo’ pa, he
done think you done gone to Mr. Damon’s.
But Massa Ned he know better, ’case as how
Mr. Damon say on the tellyfoam dat you isn’t
dere. Koku, he out lookin’ fo’ you, too.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Were you also looking for me, Rad?” asked
Tom. “And, like Diogenes searching for an honest
man, were you looking for me with a lantern?
Or were you digging to find my body?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I doan know dat fellah doggoneyourknees,”
stated Eradicate. “An’ I was goin’ to look fo’
you right soon. But jest now I come out to dig
fo’ night-walker worms. I’s gwine fishin’ to-morrow.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, so that’s why you were so mysteriously
digging, was it?” chuckled Tom. “After night-walkers!
Well, I guess I’d better do a little
night walking, myself, back to the house and
tell Ned he needn’t get up a searching party for
me. Light your lantern, Rad, and get all the
worms you can. Good luck to you!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, sah,” murmured the colored man, who
often went out in the fields and garden at night
to dig for the big worms that did not venture
abroad until after dark. “An’ I’s mighty glad,
Massa Tom, dat you isn’t a h’ant!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The same here,” chuckled Tom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The young inventor decided to see Ned before
going into his own house, and a little later
he was being greeted with delighted surprise by
Ned and Mr. Newton, who were much puzzled
to account for the long-continued absence of
the young inventor. It was now close to midnight,
and he had disappeared in the morning.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, for the love of my cash balance, what
has happened to you, Tom?” cried Ned, as he
greeted his chum.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Lots,” was the brief answer. “Have you
seen that scoundrel Barsky?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Barsky!” cried Ned. “Why, we thought you
had taken him away to some quiet place to work
on your train-stop invention. But we’ve been
a bit worried about you for some time, and
when, a little while ago, Mr. Damon said you
weren’t at his place and Mrs. Baggert telephoned
that you had not come home, we didn’t
know what to tell your father. We’ve been
keeping from him the fact that you haven’t been
seen for a number of hours, and dad and I were
just wondering how much longer we could keep
him in ignorance.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I’m glad you didn’t have to worry
him,” said Tom. “I’m all right now. But
we’ve got to catch this Barsky. Where’s
Koku?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Out looking for you, I imagine. He seemed
to think you might be about the grounds somewhere.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I was. In the old cistern. I got out through
the tunnel.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tom quickly told all that had occurred up to
the time when Eradicate mistook him for a
ghost.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Whew!” whistled Ned. “This means something,
Tom! Those fellows are getting desperate!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I should say so!” agreed the young inventor.
“I don’t just see what the game is, but it’s a
deep one, I’m afraid. I must look at once to
my chest of secrets.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was all right when I left the office, Tom,”
said Mr. Newton. “I looked at it the last
thing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m taking no chances,” was the grim reply.
“I’ll just let my father know I’ve come back.
Let him suppose that I have been over to Waterford.
Don’t tell him what happened. It
would do no good and only worry him. Then
we’ll make some plans for catching this fellow
Barsky and those in with him. For he isn’t
working alone, I’m sure of that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, I suppose not,” returned Ned. “But
now, Tom, you’d better go home and get some
rest. It’s nearly midnight.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, no, Ned! The first thing is to look
around the shops and the yards. It’s better not
to let the trail grow any colder.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tom’s right,” declared Mr. Newton. “And
Ned and I will go over with you, lad.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tom Swift looked at the older man and, seeing
how white and weary he looked, he protested.
But to his protests Ned’s father would
not listen. Though the strain of the suspense
and his shame over the question of his honesty
in the matter of the theft of the Liberty Bonds—a
matter which was by no means cleared up—was
telling heavily against him and was depleting
his strength, Mr. Newton insisted on accompanying
Tom and Ned to the Swift home and
the shops.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Though Mr. Swift had been given no intimation
that there was anything wrong with the
continued absence of his son, yet the aged inventor
had begun to worry slightly. However,
this was ended when he knew Tom was in the
house, and then the old gentleman went to bed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tom, with the Newtons, made an inspection
of the shop and found everything apparently all
right there, with the chest locked and in its
usual place in the small room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Koku came back from one of his tours of the
grounds, and he was delighted to find his master
had returned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You must keep specially good watch tonight,
Koku,” said Tom when the place had
been looked over. “I’ve got to take something
to stop my headache, and I’ll probably sleep
like a top.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Koku watch,” was the grim answer. “Bad
mans come—Koku knock ’um in mince pie
pieces!” and he clenched his big fists.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Though much puzzled over what had happened,
Tom realized that little could be done
toward solving the problem until he had had
some rest, food and sleep. His head was aching
and he had a queer sense of foreboding.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I guess I’ll be all right after I’ve had a
good night’s sleep,” he told himself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Newtons went home, Eradicate had long
before come in from his worm-digging expedition,
and by one o’clock the house, grounds and
shops of the Swift company were shrouded in
darkness and silence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tom awakened the next morning, feeling
much refreshed. As soon as he was out of bed
and had eaten breakfast he began to make plans
for apprehending the man who had attacked
him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If I get this fellow Barsky—though I don’t
believe that’s his name—I may be able to trace
the others in the plot,” reasoned Tom. “For
I believe he’s acting with others. He was the
spy. I must find Barsky!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tom hurried over to his office. It was early,
neither Ned nor his father having arrived, and
Tom was the first one to enter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hello, Koku!” he called, for the giant slept
in the place. “Any trouble during the night?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was no answer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He must be sleeping yet,” thought Tom,
“Well, we were all up a bit late.” He went into
the room where his chest of secrets, as Ned had
named it, was kept, and the instant he opened
the door Tom saw that the oak box was gone!</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They’ve got it!” he cried. “Koku! Come
here! Where are you? How does it happen
that my chest is gone? You’re a fine watchman!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He threw open the door of the room where the
giant slept.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Koku, too was gone!</p>

<div><h1 id='ch19'>CHAPTER XIX<br/> <span class='sub-head'>KOKU IS FOUND</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Tom Swift</span> lost little time in putting into
operation such means as were at his command
for tracing the missing chest of secrets and the
vanished giant.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He pressed certain push buttons connected
with distant summoning bells, located in different
parts of the works, and soon there came
flocking into his office several of his foremen
and Garret Jackson, who had general charge of
the works.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As the last of these helpers arrived, Ned Newton
and his father reached the office for the
day’s work, and it was with no little surprise
that they observed this gathering.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s wrong, Tom?” cried Ned. “Has
anything happened?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I should say there has!” cried the young inventor.
“My chest of secrets has been taken
away!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Whew!” whistled Ned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“With Koku here to guard it!” cried Mr.
Newton. “How was that possible?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, the robbers took Koku also,” explained
Tom. “He’s gone, and so is my chest.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Both gone!” cried Mr. Jackson. “Is there
any coincidence here, Tom? Maybe Koku took
the chest!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nonsense!” exclaimed Tom. “I’d trust that
giant with my last dollar. Besides, Koku hasn’t
any more notion of the value of the plans and
patent papers in my chest than he has of how to
work out a cross-word puzzle. It isn’t in him
to plan or carry out anything like this, even if
he had the wish, which he hasn’t.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s your theory, Tom, of the two disappearing
at the same time?” asked Ned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, Koku must have surprised the robbers
at work lifting my chest out,” explained Tom.
“That being so, he went at them. They killed
him and carried him off with them, or else his
body is hidden around here somewhere. That’s
why I summoned you men,” he went on to his
foremen. “I want a search made of every part
of the house and grounds. Let the work go
for the day. Koku and the chest must be
found!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It would take a pretty big and husky bunch
of robbers to overcome Koku,” suggested Ned.
“And if there was such a big gang here they
would have made a noise, which I should think
you’d have heard up at the house, Tom.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I didn’t hear a thing. Perhaps having taken
a headache powder would account for that.
But neither Eradicate nor Mrs. Baggert heard
anything out of the ordinary, I’m sure, or they
would have said something about it to me. As
for dad, when he goes to bed he sleeps, and does
little else.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Even if you didn’t hear a row, Tom, there
must have been one,” insisted Ned. “Koku
wouldn’t let that chest be taken away without
a fight, and when he starts to fight something
breaks.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, that’s the puzzling part of it,” admitted
the young inventor. “There isn’t any evidence
of anything having been disturbed here. But
I found one of the outer doors open, and the
electric alarm cut, which shows how the robbers
entered and left. They probably used a skeleton
key to open the place, and didn’t lock the
door after them when they left. I wish I had
done what I’ve been planning to do—kept my
plans in a burglar-proof vault. Now I’m going
to start to build one right here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Any signs of a fight or a struggle in Koku’s
bedroom?” asked the foreman of the pattern
shop.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No. The clothes are thrown back off the
bed as though the giant got up in the usual
way,” answered Tom. “There is no sign of violence.
But several heads are better than one,
and that’s why I summoned you all here—I’d
like your advice on the matter.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The men were trained observers, quick and
accurate in their work, as they needs must be
to build the complicated machines evolved by
Tom Swift and his father. In a sense, they
were as good observers as detectives would have
been, and Tom did not want to call in the police.
He did not want his loss broadcasted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This is fierce!” exclaimed Ned, as the extent
of the loss was more fully realized. He and
Tom were sitting in the office while the foremen
moved about the place, looking for possible
clews in the place where the chest had stood, in
Koku’s room, and outside the building.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It sure is,” agreed the young inventor. “All
my plans for the train-stopping device were in
that chest. Now they’re gone, and I have no
duplicates!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And your tidal engine, too,” suggested Ned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” sighed Tom. “I guess my dream of
harnessing the ocean will not be realized for
some time. Of course I may be able to work
out the ideas in some other way, but it means
a big loss. And there are other papers, too.
There were dad’s designs of the gyroscope flier,
and——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s that about my gyroscope flier?”
asked Mr. Swift, at that moment entering the
place. “I’ve come for those plans now, Tom.
I have just thought of a new idea in connection
with the engine.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m afraid you can’t have the plans, Dad,”
returned the son. “They’re gone! The whole
chest of secrets has been stolen!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tom had been debating in his mind whether
or not to tell his father the bad news, fearing
the effect it might have on the elderly man’s
heart. But Barton Swift was no weakling.
Like a charger sniffing the powder of battle from
afar, he drew himself up and together at the
same time crying:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So our enemies are at some of their old
tricks, are they, Tom? Well, don’t let them see
that we mind! Don’t show the white feather.
We’ll fight ’em, Tom! We’ll fight ’em!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s the talk!” cried Ned, while Tom was
much delighted to note that his father took the
blow standing up.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can reconstruct those gyroscope plans!”
cried the old man. “I remember most of them,
though it will set me back very much to have
them taken. Of course it’s a big loss, Tom.
The whole chestful gone! How did it happen?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was told, and then he confirmed Tom’s
first idea that he had heard nothing during the
night to indicate an attack on the shop.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I done t’ink I heard somethin’,” Eradicate
said when they asked him about the matter.
“It was a sort of hootin’, hollerin’ sound. But
I figgered it was an owl bird, an’ I went to sleep
again!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That was probably Koku shouting at the
robbers,” decided Tom. “He’s either still after
them or they’ve done for him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Koku gone?” cried Rad, and when told him
that the giant was missing the colored man forgot
all his petty animosity against the big fellow
and expressed only sympathy. “I’s gwine to
find him!” declared Eradicate. “I go look for
him!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tom did not pay much attention to his colored
helper, since there were other matters that
needed his attention. The net result of the
searching on the part of his men was nothing.
There were no clews that could be followed.
Reconstructing the crime, it was thought that
the gang of men had gained entrance by means
of a false key. Then, being unable to open the
chest because of the special locks on it, they had
carried it away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Surprised at this by Koku, they must have
silenced the giant in some manner and have carried
him off while he was unconscious. Doubtless
an auto was used, though so many of these
came and went at the Swift office that the tire
marks of no special one could be picked out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All that remains is for us to make a search,”
suggested Tom. “And we have this much to go
on—that I suspect my chest was stolen by the
same men, or some representing them, whose
offer I turned down when Mr. Damon made it
on behalf of Mr. Blythe.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then why not have Mr. Damon over here,”
suggested Mr. Swift. “He may be able to give
us some clews as to these scoundrels.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll do it!” cried Tom, and he sent an airship
for Wakefield Damon at once.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bless my fire insurance policy, Tom Swift,
but this is a terrible affair!” cried the odd man
when he entered the office a little later. “I
wouldn’t have had it happen for a million dollars!
Bless my check book if I would! And
it’s all my fault.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How do you make that out?” asked Tom,
with a smile.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I was foolish enough to bring you that offer
from Mr. Blythe, though I took it in good faith,
and never knew he was such a scoundrel! To
think of his kidnapping Koku and taking your
chest.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Blythe didn’t do it!” exclaimed Tom. “Nor
did he have anything to do with it! Blythe
isn’t that kind of a man. I know that from my
oil-gusher dealings with him. Doubtless he has
been deceived by these men as I was deceived
by Barsky. And I think if we could get hold
of Barsky we’d have the key that would unlock
this whole puzzle. Why we sent for you, Mr.
Damon, is to ask if you could give us any clews
as to the men associated with Blythe.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think I can,” was the answer. “Oh, Tom
Swift, to think that such a thing could happen!
Bless my overshoes! it’s enough to make a man
a misanthrope all the rest of his life.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>By dint of further questioning Tom and Ned
gleaned certain facts from Mr. Damon, and
these were a little later communicated to Mr.
Plum, the lawyer, with instructions to set certain
confidential investigators at work in distant
cities.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you think, Mr. Plum, that this robbery
here had any connection with the theft of the
Liberty Bonds of which my father is accused?”
asked Ned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t know,” was the answer. “It’s possible.
There’s no obvious connection, but I’ll
check up on the matter and let you know.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>With this Tom and Ned had to be content for
the time being. After all the information possible
had been collected, the foremen went back
to their shops and work was resumed. Mr.
Swift at once began to redraw his gyroscope
plans, and Tom, sick at heart over his big loss,
late in the afternoon spoke to Ned about the
advisability of going for a ride across country.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We might get a trace of Koku or the robbers
in that way,” Tom said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good idea,” commented Ned. “It will be
something to be on the move. Nothing is worse
than sitting still waiting for news. Come on.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As they were about to start in the electric runabout,
Eradicate, who had disappeared soon
after the discovery of the robbery, came hurrying
to the garage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Massa Tom! Massa Tom!” cried the colored
man, much excited. “I’s done found ’im!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Found them? You mean Koku and my
chest of secrets?” shouted the young inventor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, I didn’t find de chest, but I found Koku!
I found dat big giant!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is he—is he dead?” faltered Tom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, Massa Tom. Dat giant’s off in de
woods tied to a tree! I couldn’t loose de ropes
or I’d a set him free. Dat’s why I came back
fo’ you all. But I done found Koku!”</p>

<div><h1 id='ch20'>CHAPTER XX<br/> <span class='sub-head'>MANY STRANGE CLEWS</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='sc'>Come</span> on, Rad! Hop in! Show us where
Koku is and we’ll soon have him loose!” cried
Tom, as he motioned to the rear of the runabout,
for he and Ned were seated in front.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How is Koku taking being tied up?” asked
Ned while the colored man climbed in as
quickly as his rheumatic joints would allow.
“Is Koku mad?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mad? He done froth at de mouth!” cried
the old servant. “By golly, I wouldn’t like to
be de one whut done tied him up after he gits
free!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Koku would be one of the best fellows in the
world to take along on the search for the robbers,
Tom,” suggested Ned. “He’ll be so angry
he can easily handle half a dozen with one hand—if
there should prove to be that many in the
gang.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Shouldn’t wonder but what there are more
than that in the plot,” agreed Tom. “It’s a
queer game! But come on. We must help
Koku. Where is he, Rad?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Over by Lake Carlopa—dat place where you
and me used to go fishin’.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You mean Chestnut Point?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dat’s de place, Massa Tom.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A lonely region,” remarked the young inventor,
as he started the runabout. “They couldn’t
have picked out a better—or rather, a worse—place
to leave poor Koku. How’d you happen
to think of looking there, Rad?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, Massa Tom, I t’ought maybe Koku
might go there of his own se’f. Onct I kotched
a big fish there, an’ I was tellin’ him ’bout it.
He always said he could kotch a bigger fish’n
whut I did. So I t’ought maybe he was tryin’
to beat me, an’ maybe de robbers didn’t tuk him
after all. So I looked an’ I done see him tied
to a tree!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The run to Chestnut Point did not take long,
and, following the directions of Eradicate, Tom
guided his machine along a lonely road. They
had traversed this a short distance when Ned
cried:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hark!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What did you think you heard?” asked
Tom, shutting off the motor to render the machine
silent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Some one calling,” answered Ned. “Listen!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A loud voice was borne to their ears by the
wind, and Tom had no sooner heard it than he
cried:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s Koku! And he sure is mad!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The giant was like an enraged bull, but so securely
was he bound to a tree with many strong
ropes and straps that even his great strength
was of no avail, especially as he was so cunningly
bound that he was unable to exert his
full strength.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good you come, Master Tom,” grunted
Koku, as he saw his friends approaching in a
run. “You friend of mine from now on, Rad—you
bring help to me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Cou’se I’s you’ friend,” chuckled Eradicate.
“De only time when we has any disputations is
when you tries to take my place wif Massa
Tom.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was the work of some time for Ned and
Tom, even with their sharp knives, to cut the
straps and the ropes, the knots of which had
proved too hard for the colored man to loosen.
Then, working his great arms and striding up
and down amid the trees to restore his stagnant
circulation, the giant cried:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where are ’um? Where are ’um mans that
tied me? Once I git ’um—I mince pie ’um!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Guess he’s heard the expression ‘make mince
meat of them,’ ” remarked Ned to Tom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Very likely. But I’ve got to get him quieted
down so I can question him. He will be the
best one to give us clews by which we may trace
these fellows.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Accordingly Tom talked to his giant helper
and finally got an account of what had happened.
Tom could do more with Koku and understand
his peculiar English better than any
one else. Also Tom knew something of the
giant’s own language.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gradually a coherent story emerged. Koku
had been left on guard the previous night in
Tom’s private office building, following the attack
on the young inventor. The early part of
the evening had passed without anything to disturb
the giant’s sleep. Later, however, the
alarm bell over his bed rang. Tom had not
trusted altogether to his giant remaining awake
when on guard, and, as old readers know, the
whole place was wired in burglar alarm fashion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So that, even though the door was opened
with a skeleton key, as was proved later to have
been done, the swinging of the portal set off one
signal, the wire to which had remained intact,
and Koku awakened.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had been awakened some months before
by the alarm bell, but that time it was Tom
himself who entered the place late at night to
make notes on a certain plan before he should
forget the idea that occurred to him. Tom forgot
about the burglar alarm, and set it off,
bringing Koku running with a gun in his hands.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Of course Tom laughed at the incident, but
Koku now remembered this, and, thinking it
might be another false alarm, he did not at once
rush to the floor below, but proceeded cautiously.
If the intruder should prove to be some
one with a right to enter, Koku would go back
to bed again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Going down softly, and looking in the room
where the big oak box was kept, the giant saw
several strange men trying to force the locks.
This being beyond them, one of the men had
cried, as Koku understood it:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let’s take the whole shooting match along!
The <span class='it'>Blue Bird</span> will carry it and we can open it
in the woods.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So they had picked up Tom Swift’s chest of
secrets and carried it out of the office. Even
then Koku did not give the alarm, for his brain
did not work as fast as the brain of an ordinary
person. Then, too, the giant thought he had
plenty of time, and could, when he got ready,
sweep the robbers off their feet and take the
chest away from them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But he delayed too long. Following the men—there
were eight of them, he counted on his
fingers—Koku went out of the office building
into the darkness. The men carried the chest
to a large automobile that was waiting in the
road, the motor running and the lights off.
Then, just as they loaded it in and Koku was
about to spring on them, the men discovered
his presence and jumped on the giant before he
could get into action.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Even a little man will have the advantage of
a much larger and more powerful fellow if the
little man gets started first, and this was what
happened in the case of Koku. Besides, there
were eight of the robbers, and though under
some circumstances Koku might have been able
to fight eight, or even ten men, taken as he was
by surprise, he was knocked down.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He struggled, but the men threw “something
into his face” that stung and made him “feel
funny” and he was gagged, bound and lifted into
the auto, though his weight made the men
“grunt like pigs,” as the giant expressed it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So the thing happened, and Koku, helpless, a
little stunned, and silent, was driven off in the
night, no struggle at all having taken place in
the office.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Where he was taken the giant did not know
in the darkness. But after a while he was lifted
out of the car and tied to the tree where Eradicate
found him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But what became of the robbers and Tom’s
chest?” asked Ned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ’Um robbers go off in <span class='it'>Blue Bird</span> with chest
of secrets,” answered the giant.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What does he mean—<span class='it'>Blue Bird</span>?” asked
the manager.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s a big aeroplane painted blue,” explained
Tom. “The men had it hidden in a cove on the
lake. It must be a hydroplane, though possibly
it’s a combination of both types of machine.
Koku had a glimpse of it because the robbers
used pocket flashlights. They put the chest in
the blue aeroplane and soared off with it. Koku
said he could hear the throb of the motors for
a long time after they were gone.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s the next thing to be done?” asked
Ned. “We can’t do anything here, and it’s getting
late. Did Koku see any of the faces of
these fellows?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They all wore masks,” Tom said. “Yes,
Koku, what is it?” the young inventor asked,
for he noticed that his giant wanted to tell him
something in addition.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Followed then more of the queer, jumbled
talk of the big man, who, now and then, used
some of his own words, which Tom alone could
translate. Then came silence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He says,” interpreted Tom, “that one of the
men walked with a slight limp and had a queer
habit of throwing his left elbow out from his
side.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Limping! Throwing out his elbow!” excitedly
cried Ned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Does that mean anything to you?” asked
Tom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Does it? I should say it does. Why, that’s
the very thing Renwick Fawn does!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Renwick Fawn!” exclaimed Tom. “You
mean——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The man who accused my father of taking
the Liberty Bonds!” fairly shouted Ned. “I
always thought that fellow was a crook, and
now I know it. Tom, he’s in with the scoundrels
that robbed you!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Maybe,” assented the young inventor. “I
wouldn’t put it past him, since I’ve had a look
at his face. But if this is the case, we have several
clews to work on now, Ned. The limping
man with the queer elbow action, the blue aeroplane,
and some other things that Koku told
me. Let’s go back and get busy!”</p>

<div><h1 id='ch21'>CHAPTER XXI<br/> <span class='sub-head'>SCOUTING AROUND</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Fairly</span> well satisfied that he had secured
some clews that would be of value to him, Tom
Swift hurried home with Ned, Koku and Eradicate
in the electric runabout. On the way the
giant recovered somewhat from the rough treatment
accorded him by the robbers, and talked
of what he would do to them when he caught
them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You must be hungry,” suggested Ned, as
they neared Shopton. For Koku had been
taken away the previous midnight and evening
was now coming on again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Me eat ten loaves of bread!” cried the giant,
opening wide his enormous mouth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’ll give you something else, too!” chuckled
Tom. “But I know poor Mrs. Baggert will
almost faint when she sees you begin to eat.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The giant’s appetite was always a source of
wonder to the housekeeper, and now, starved as
he was by his enforced fast, it might reasonably
be expected that he would clean out the pantry.
Tom had the foresight to stop and telephone
word to Mrs. Baggert of the situation, so she
sent out and got in plenty of food before the
wayfarers returned. Thus was Koku provided
for.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, Ned, let’s get together and talk this
thing over,” suggested Tom to his manager,
leaving the giant still eating, long after the
others had finished. Eradicate, true to his promise
to be friends with the big man, remained
to help serve him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” agreed Ned, “we had better make
some plan to work on. But this discovery that
Renwick Fawn is in the plot rather surprises
me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I must see if Mr. Damon knows anything
about him in this connection. He may have
heard Blythe speak of him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Damon was communicated with over the
telephone, and after several queer “blessings”
announced that, as far as he knew, Fawn was a
stranger to Mr. Blythe.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He doesn’t know anything of Blodgett
either,” Tom told Ned, recalling the conversation
Mary had overheard in the restaurant.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then we’ll have to tackle Fawn on our own
account,” said Ned. “I know where he lives.
Shall we go to his house and ask for him?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What shall we say to him if he’s at home?”
Tom wanted to know.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ned thought for a moment and replied:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We can ask him, for a starter, if he has recovered
any of the Liberty Bonds he says my
father took. Then, after that opening, you can
mention the theft of your box and ask if Fawn
thinks there is any connection between the two.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then what?” Tom inquired.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, if things turn out the way we expect—I
mean if this Fawn has really had a part in
the robbery at your place—he’ll get confused
and maybe give himself away. That’s our one
hope—that he will give himself away.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s worth trying,” decided Tom, after a little
consideration. “Come on.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A little later in the evening the two young
men set off in a small gasoline car to call at the
home of the suspected man. Ned had had
occasion to go there before some time since,
months prior to the accusation against Mr.
Newton.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But it was with some feelings of apprehension
and with wonderings as to what they had
best say to the man when he saw them that Ned
and Tom walked up the steps of the Fawn home.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A maid answered the door, and when they
said they had called to see Mr. Fawn she remarked:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think Mr. Fawn is not at home, but Mrs.
Fawn is. Please come in and I will tell her you
are here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Fawn, a small, pale, unimpressive woman,
came timidly into the room where the boys
waited.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You wanted to see my husband?” she asked,
and Tom jumped at once to the conclusion (in
which Ned later joined) that she knew nothing
of the man’s peculiar activities. Their feeling
that he was a brute and a bully toward her was
afterward borne out by facts.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We have some business to transact with Mr.
Fawn,” stated Ned. “But the maid said he
wasn’t at home.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, he isn’t,” answered Mrs. Fawn, and the
boys did not doubt her. “He has gone to Chicago
on business. At least I think it is
Chicago,” she added. “He goes to so many
places I sometimes forget. But I know it was
out West.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, if he’s that far off, I guess we can’t see
him to-night,” returned Tom with a smile as he
arose to go. “When did he leave town?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The day before yesterday,” answered Mrs.
Fawn.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ned had not given his name, and though Tom
had mentioned his, he did not believe Mrs.
Fawn knew enough of her husband’s business
to connect her callers with the bond accusation
against Mr. Newton.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the two young men glanced sharply at
each other when Mrs. Fawn spoke of her husband
having gone to Chicago two days previous.
If that was the case he could hardly
have been engaged in the theft of Tom’s strong
box.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you want to leave any word for Mr.
Fawn when he returns?” asked his wife.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thank you, no,” answered Tom. “It wasn’t
important. We’ll see him when he gets back.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>When they were outside Ned asked:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, what do you think now, Tom?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t know what to think. Koku is pretty
sharp. When he says he saw a thing you can
make up your mind that he did. Of course it’s
possible there may be two men who limp and
throw out their left elbows, you know.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s possible, but not very probable,” answered
the young manager. “I believe Fawn
is guilty, but his wife may not, and very likely
doesn’t, know anything about it. She’s a meek
little lady.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, indeed,” agreed Tom. “Well, we’re
stuck for the time being. However, to-morrow
is another day. Something may turn up then.
Anyhow, even if it doesn’t, I’m going to start
out.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Start out where?” Ned wanted to know.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To look for that blue aero-hydroplane. I’m
going to scout around in the <span class='it'>Blackbird</span> and see
if I can’t get on the trail of the fellows who have
my chest of secrets.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’d like to go with you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wouldn’t think of taking off without you,
old scout!” cried Tom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He guided the car down the street and out on
a wide avenue, going along at a steady pace
and with such an evident object in view that
Ned asked:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where are you heading?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I thought I’d stop at the Nestors’ a minute,”
answered Tom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then let me out here and I’ll take a trolley
home,” said Ned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let you out here! What’s the idea?” cried
Tom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, you’re going to call on Mary, and——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Forget it!” laughed Tom, clapping his chum
on the back. “This is a sort of joint call, and
you’re coming in. Mary isn’t fussy that way,
and she always likes to see you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thanks,” murmured Ned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The two young men were no strangers in the
Nestor home, Tom especially; and soon the
whole family was in conversation. Tom mentioned
the fact that he and his chum had just
called on Mr. Fawn but found that he had
left for the West two days before.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Left for the West!” exclaimed Mr. Nestor.
“That’s queer!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why so?” Tom asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Because I saw him in town yesterday morning.
And he couldn’t have been going to Chicago.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are you sure?” inquired Ned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course. I know the man as well as I
know you. He was limping along, tossing his
left elbow out every now and then as he has a
habit of doing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ned and Tom glanced at one another. If
this was the case it would explain matters.
Fawn may have told his wife he was leaving for
Chicago, and even have packed a bag to go.
But he went to some other place and remained
about Shopton long enough to take part in the
robbery that night.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Nestor’s mention of the peculiar gait of
the man and his habit of tossing his left elbow
away from his body while walking or talking
was almost positive proof that there could be
no mistake.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Tom was not yet ready to let it be known
that Fawn was caught in a falsehood. There
were many more points to be cleared up before
the affair was on the way to be solved. So,
passing the matter off as though it did not
amount to much, murmuring that possibly he
had misunderstood Mrs. Fawn, Tom turned the
talk into other channels.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The chums left the Nestor home near midnight,
Mary expressing her indignation at the
loss inflicted on Tom and asking if she could
not do something to help.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll let you know if you can,” Tom told her
as he pressed her hands.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For a few minutes Tom and Ned rode on in
silence, each busy with his thoughts, and then
Ned asked:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, Tom, what do you make of it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You mean about Fawn not going to Chicago
at all?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well it means he’s a trickster surely, but
more than that. He’s in the plot, of course.
And I’m beginning to believe that it’s bigger
than I thought. Fawn and Barsky—both in
the same town, both probably working together
against dad and me. It was a sorry day when
I let that so-called Russian into my shop!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It surely was,” agreed Ned. “But it’s too
late to think of that now. What is the next
move? I want to get my hands on Fawn, as
well as on the others.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We start scouting to-morrow morning!” decided
the young inventor. “It oughtn’t to be
hard to pick up the trail of this blue aeroplane.
I had some inquiries made around Lake Carlopa,
and she seems to have headed west. That,
naturally, would be the best place for the robbers
to go—plenty of open places to land, and
with widely scattered cities and towns they
wouldn’t run so much risk of being captured.
We’ll start scouting in the morning.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Accordingly the <span class='it'>Blackbird</span> was made ready.
This craft was not as small nor as speedy as the
<span class='it'>Hummer</span>, but she would carry three, and Tom
decided to take Koku along to identify the robbers
if possible.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good luck, Tom!” called his aged father,
as he was ready to take off the next morning.
“Bring back that chest!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll do my best!” was the answer.</p>

<div><h1 id='ch22'>CHAPTER XXII<br/> <span class='sub-head'>A STRANGE MESSAGE</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Though</span> he had no more than very slight
clews on which to pursue the robbers, Tom
Swift was not without a definite plan on which
he proposed to operate.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As he had mentioned to Ned, he had obtained
information which indicated that the big blue
aeroplane, after the robbers had put the chest
on board and had left Koku tied to the tree, had
departed toward the west. Of course there was
no guarantee that it would keep on this course,
and absolutely no way of telling how long it
would hold it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But we can stop from time to time,” said
Tom to Ned, “and make inquiries about the
plane. A big blue aeroplane isn’t easily hidden
from sight.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It sounds like good dope,” agreed Ned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Koku was no stranger to aeroplane rides, and
he felt perfectly at home in the <span class='it'>Blackbird</span>. Indeed,
as those of you remember who have read
the earlier books of this series, Koku was
brought from his home in a strange land by an
airship. He rather liked to ride in them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So Tom, Ned and Koku flew off on their
strange quest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Up into the air soared the <span class='it'>Blackbird</span>. She
was a powerful machine, and, as has been said,
was roomy. Really, she was built to carry
four, but on account of the size of Koku a partition
between two cockpits had been taken out,
making a large space where he could dispose of
his enormous legs and big body.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Before starting on the search for his chest
of secrets, Tom had caused inquiries to be made
about the missing Barsky. But the man seemed
to have disappeared completely after leaving
Tom in the cistern.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Though of course he might have been, and
probably was, one of the gang that took the
chest and bound Koku,” suggested Ned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For several hours the trio of adventurers
soared along, not going so high but what they
could from time to time make observations of
the earth below them through field glasses. For
of course it was possible that the blue aeroplane
might be on the ground.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She also might be soaring along in the air,
and Tom and Ned did not neglect to scan the
heavens for signs. Once they saw a plane coasting
along, and gave chase. But when within
good viewing distance they made out that it
was one of the government mail-carriers, and
they turned back on their original course.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was near noon when Ned heard Tom give a
sudden exclamation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“See anything?” asked the young manager.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nothing that gives me any pleasure,” replied
Tom grimly. “I see a leak in one of the
oil pipes and that means we’ve got to go down
and mend it. Lucky I discovered it in time!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>An aeroplane engine, or for that matter an
auto motor, that does not receive copious and
continuous lubrication is going to overheat,
bind and stop in a surprisingly short time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A look over the side showed Tom that they
were flying across fairly open country, and, picking
out a broad meadow as a suitable landing
place, he, having shut off his motor, headed for
it. Koku, half asleep in his enlarged cockpit,
sensed that they were going down and asked:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We catch ’um robbers?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not yet, Koku,” replied Tom, with a grim
laugh. “So far they are a couple of tricks
ahead of us, but the game has only started.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The <span class='it'>Blackbird</span> made a perfect landing under
Tom’s skillful guidance, and when it had come
to a stop after a run over the somewhat uneven
field, Tom and Ned got out to begin work on
repairing the oil pipe. Ned had some knowledge
of mechanics, and could at least help his
chum.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It isn’t as bad as I thought,” Tom said,
after a careful inspection. “It’s just a loose
union connection, and not a break. I won’t
have to solder anything, and I think I have a
spare union in the tool box.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was while he was looking for this and
while Koku was strolling about, heaving big
stones for his own amusement (and possibly
with the sensation that he was thus treating his
enemies) that Ned called:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Some one’s coming, Tom!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The young inventor, who had found the
union connection he was looking for, looked up
and saw a farmer approaching across the field.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Maybe he’s going to order us off,” suggested
Ned. “We’re trespassers all right. Didn’t even
ask his leave to drop in on him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, we didn’t have time,” grimly chuckled
Tom. “But if he makes a fuss I guess a few
dollars will make him see the light of reason.
I’ve dealt with that kind before.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>However, the farmer, for such he proved to
be, was a friendly person. He smiled at the
chums, looked with amazement at Koku, who
was lifting a rock that three ordinary men could
not have handled, and then asked:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are you having trouble? Can I help you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thank you, very much,” responded Tom.
“It’s only a slight defect, and I’ll have it mended
in a minute or two.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We thought possibly you were coming to
order us off,” said Ned, as he got ready to help
his chum replace the broken union on the oil
feed pipe.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, no,” laughed the farmer, who gave his
name as Mr. Kimball. “We’re getting used to
aeroplanes landing here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You mean the government machines?”
asked Tom. “I know this is their route.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, a mail plane was forced down in this
field last year,” said Mr. Kimball. “But I didn’t
mean that. Only yesterday a big blue machine
had to come down about where you are.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A blue machine?” repeated Tom, concealing
his excitement.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Regular landing or a crash dive?” asked
Ned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I guess they came down on purpose,” said
Mr. Kimball. “They landed gently enough—no
crash. It seems they ran out of water in
their radiator. That’s happened to me many a
time in my little Ford, so I knew just how they
felt about it. I came over and showed them a
spring where they could get water. Then they
went on again.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ned and Tom looked at each other. They
did not want to tell too much of their plans, yet
they must make inquiries and get information.
Koku was still doing his “daily dozen” with
the big rocks.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How many men were in this blue machine?”
asked Tom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, four or five, I should say. Maybe half
a dozen. It was the biggest aeroplane I’ve ever
seen. But then they look a lot bigger on the
ground than when they’re up in the air.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It must have been a pretty good-sized plane
to carry four or five men,” observed Ned. “Did
you notice any of the passengers? Did one of
them walk with a limp?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, yes, come to think of it, one of them
did seem a bit lame,” replied Mr. Kimball.
“And he had a queer habit of jerking his elbow
out like this,” and the farmer illustrated.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Was it his <span class='it'>right</span> elbow?” asked Tom, emphasizing
the word that indicated the dexter
hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No—let me see now—no, it was his left.
Why? Do you know him?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” answered Ned, with a queer look at
Tom. “We know him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I suppose they’re friends of yours, both of
you being in the airship business, so to speak,”
went on Mr. Kimball.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Neither of the young men answered that, but
Tom, after he had taken off the damaged union
coupling, asked:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did you happen to notice if one of the men
had red hair?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The farmer considered for a moment, and
then replied:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, I didn’t see any one like that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>This was not surprising, considering that
Barsky’s hair was so short that its redness could
not be noticed until he took off his hat. And
very likely he would be wearing a leather helmet
in the aeroplane.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Tom and Ned had established the fact
that the blue aeroplane containing the robbers
had passed this way recently. Tom made a
cautious inquiry about the chest, but Mr. Kimball
had not noticed that. And, very likely, it
was stowed away in the fuselage of the craft,
out of sight.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How long did they stay?” asked Ned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, only long enough to buy some food off
me and take on water, then they soared away
again.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Headed west?” asked Tom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Headed west,” answered Mr. Kimball.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The farmer remained, an interested observer,
while Tom and Ned made the slight repairs
needed. When they had finished and were about
to go on, Mr. Kimball, with a glance toward
the giant, asked:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is he yours?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, in a way,” replied Tom. “Why?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Um! I only want to say if you ever want
to get rid of him I’d like to hire him. What a
hired man he’d make! My, the chores he
could do without getting tired! He’d be worth
three ordinary hired men—and they’re so hard
to get now. But I don’t suppose you want to
let him go?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” answered Tom, with a laugh and a
glance at Koku, who, to amuse himself, was
tossing up great rocks and catching them in his
bare hands.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I don’t know as I blame you,” said
Mr. Kimball.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Having made repairs and gotten some unexpected
and valuable information, Tom and Ned
called to the giant, took their places in the machine
again, and, after Koku had spun the propeller,
once more were off.</p>

<p class='pindent'>All that day they traveled, Tom and his chum
keeping a lookout for the blue machine, but not
seeing it. The young inventor had so laid his
plans that before it got too dark he descended
in a broad field on the outskirts of a big city.
As the aeroplane was large enough to permit of
sleeping in it and as Tom had brought along
blankets, they decided to spend the night in the
<span class='it'>Blackbird</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was the next morning about nine o’clock,
and just about the time Tom and Ned were
taking off again on the second day of their trip,
that Mr. Swift was summoned to the telephone
in his office.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dey’s somebody dat wants to talk to you
’ticklar like,” reported Eradicate.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Perhaps it’s a message from Tom!” exclaimed
Mr. Swift. “He may have caught the
robbers and gotten back his chest.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, sah, it don’t sound like Massa Tom,”
said the colored man.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The voice to which the aged inventor listened
was not that of his son. Instead, over the wire
came strange tones asking:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How much will you pay us for the return
of your chest of secrets?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Swift was so surprised that he almost
dropped the receiver.</p>

<div><h1 id='ch23'>CHAPTER XXIII<br/> <span class='sub-head'>THE BLUE MACHINE</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Barton Swift</span> was the true father of his energetic
son, and Tom inherited his qualities
from his father. Which is to say that in his
youth Barton Swift had been fully as active and
quick as was now the young inventor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Though age and illness had to some extent
dimmed and enfeebled the powers of the man,
still it needed but this spark—that strange telephone
message—to galvanize him into action.
After the first shock of hearing so unexpectedly
about the stolen chest of secrets, Mr. Swift was
ready to take active measures to trace the voice
coming out of the machine.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s that you say?” he asked, nerving
himself to carry on an ordinary conversation
about a most extraordinary topic. “Who are
you and where are you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t you wish you knew?” came back the
challenging inquiry. “Are you ready to talk
business?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course I am,” answered Mr. Swift. “We
want that chest back, and we’ll pay any reasonable
amount.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m not saying the amount will be reasonable,”
was the reply, and emphasis was laid on
the last word. “But you’ll pay our price or
you don’t get the chest. And I warn you that
if you try to communicate with the police or set
the detectives on our trail we’ll immediately
break off negotiations.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Trying to get in touch with the police was
just what Mr. Swift was then doing. Ned Newton’s
father had entered the office, and, seeing
him, Mr. Swift at once took pencil and paper
from his desk and while he talked in a rather
general way with his unseen listener, he jotted
down a few words, explaining matters and suggesting
that Mr. Newton go to another telephone
to learn from the central operator where
the mysterious call was coming from.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There were several trunk telephone lines running
into the Swift office, so it was a comparatively
easy matter for Mr. Newton to go to
another instrument to get the information
needed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Meanwhile Mr. Swift was holding the other
man in conversation. Having started Mr. Newton
to ferreting out some information, the aged
inventor asked:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How much do you want to return the chest
and how can I get in touch with you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If you will take fifty thousand dollars in
unmarked bills, make a bundle of them and
bring them——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But at that moment the criminal either heard
something—perhaps the movements of Mr.
Newton—or he suspected something, for he
sharply broke off what he was saying and
cried:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s all off! You’re trying to double cross
me! Now you’ll never get your chest back!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was a click which told that the distant
receiver was hung up, and then the line went
dead.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wait a minute! Wait just a moment! I
want to talk business with you!” cried Mr.
Swift, rapidly moving the hook of the receiver
up and down.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But it was too late. Only silence ensued until
finally the operator, attracted by the flashing
light which resulted when Mr. Swift moved the
hook, asked:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Number, please?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I was talking to some one, but I was cut
off,” said the inventor. “Can you get them
back for me? It’s important.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What number were you talking to?” the
girl asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s just what I want to know,” said
Tom’s father.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m sorry, but if you don’t know the number
I can’t ring it for you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Swift knew only too well that this was
the case. It was not the girl’s fault—it was the
fault of the system, and not so much the fault
as the limitation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If I had only had Tom’s photo-telephone
attachment hitched on here I could have seen
who it was I was talking with,” lamented Mr.
Swift. “How about it, Mr. Newton, did you
succeed in getting any information?” he asked,
as the latter came away from the second instrument.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The manager said he would try to trace the
call for you,” was the reply. “But I didn’t
have much time. Whoever it was got suspicious
too quickly.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” agreed the inventor. “He must have
heard me giving you the paper and he jumped
to the conclusion that there was a second person
in the room. Well, we’ll have to wait and
see what they can do for us in the central telephone
office. I wish Tom were here!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I suppose he and Ned are on the trail of
the robbers,” remarked Mr. Newton.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, but this would be a good clew for
them. However, it’s too late now. It shows,
though, that our chest is still safe. They probably
realize that they cannot make as much use
of our plans, designs and patents as they thought
at first.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s as if they stole a lot of non-negotiable
securities,” commented Mr. Newton. “They’ll
have trouble in disposing of your stuff, and
they probably think that they will get more out
of it by giving it back to you for a consideration
than by peddling the plans about the country.
In fact, no reputable manufacturer would
deal with the scoundrels.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s true, Mr. Newton! They are scoundrels.
I hope Tom catches them. As soon as
he calls up, as he will sooner or later, we must
tell him what has happened.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Tom, with Ned and Koku, taking off
about that same time for a further search after
the mysterious blue machine, had no present
intention of calling up his home, though he
realized that it would be wise to get in
communication with his father before very
long.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I want to have something to tell him
first,” said Tom to Ned. “I want to give
him news that we have at least sighted the
robbers.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Up and onward soared the <span class='it'>Blackbird</span>. After
the night of rest, though the machine was not
the most comfortable bedroom in the world, the
travelers were refreshed and ready for what
the day might bring forth. They kept on the
western trail, ascending at times to great
heights, far above the clouds, where they had
an unobstructed view of a vast expanse. This
they scanned for a sight of the blue machine.
But up to noon they had not sighted her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think I’ll circle a bit,” decided Tom, as
they ate a hasty lunch on board, Ned steering
while Tom munched sandwiches and drank milk
they had in a thermos bottle, for they had put
food in the machine at the last stopping place.
Then Tom managed the machine while Ned ate.
As Koku was not capable of operating the
<span class='it'>Blackbird</span> he could devote his whole attention
to food—and it may be said that he did so.</p>

<p class='pindent'>About the middle of the afternoon, following
his circling movements which resulted in nothing,
Tom asked Ned to take the helm for a
while.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I want to get a bit of rest,” the young inventor
explained.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sure, give me a chance to distinguish myself,”
suggested Ned, who liked to handle the
craft.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tom made himself as comfortable as possible
in his cockpit, and for an hour Ned guided the
<span class='it'>Blackbird</span>, giving Koku the glasses with which
to make observations. The giant had remarkable
sight. But even this did not succeed in
bringing into view the blue machine.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ned presently saw trouble ahead of him in
the shape of ominous black clouds, and, recognizing
them as a storm and not caring to trust
to his abilities in this emergency, he awakened
Tom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s only a thunder shower,” said the young
inventor. “Run through it, Ned.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They had often done this, sometimes shooting
up above the edge of the storm and getting
into clear air higher up, and sometimes skirting
the edge of the disturbance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This time Tom Swift miscalculated the size
of the storm, or else it suddenly developed
larger proportions after they entered it. No
sooner had the <span class='it'>Blackbird</span> pushed her beak into
the bank of black clouds than Tom awoke to
the realization that they were in considerable
danger. Not only had they rashly entered the
area of a thunderstorm, but a hail storm as
well.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In another instant the <span class='it'>Blackbird</span> was all but
overwhelmed by a fierce wind while big hailstones
fell on the wings with such force that
one or two of them ripped through the stout
fabric.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The thunder was like the sound of big guns
in the ears of the travelers, while the lightning
hissed about them in blinding sheets and jagged
forks until it seemed a miracle that they
were not struck.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This is awful!” cried Ned. “You’d better
take the wheel, Tom!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tom thought this himself. He bent his head
to the blast and endeavored to ascertain the direction
of the storm that he might steer out of
it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Koku did not seem at all afraid. In fact, he
always liked a storm, for it seemed to give him a
chance to pit his strength against the elements.
He laughed and shouted and caught up handfuls
of hailstones from his cockpit, throwing
them over the side.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Stop it!” commanded Tom. “We’ve got
trouble enough without that. Sit still!” For
the giant was moving about so that he endangered
the craft, tossed as it was in the
furious wind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>However, Tom Swift had not managed aeroplanes
several years without learning how to
handle them in fair weather and foul, and in a
short time he took the <span class='it'>Blackbird</span> out of the
storm and up above the burst of almost tropical
fury.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Whew!” whistled Tom, when he could relax
for a moment. “That was a humdinger!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You said it!” echoed Ned. “Do you think
we’re damaged any?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Can’t tell. It will be best, I think, to make
a landing and look ourselves over. It will soon
be time to tie up for the night, anyhow, and we
might as well go down now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let’s take a last look for the blue machine,”
suggested Ned. Carefully he scanned the heavens
above them and the earth below them for
a sight of the robbers, but saw nothing. Then,
having passed far beyond the thunderstorm,
they made a descent in a lonely field where they
passed the night.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was about ten o’clock the following morning
and they had been under way for about an
hour when Tom, using the glasses while Ned
ran the <span class='it'>Blackbird</span>, suddenly uttered an exclamation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What is it?” asked his chum eagerly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The blue machine, I think!” cried Tom. “I
think I see her hidden down there under some
trees. Circle a bit to the left, Ned.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>When this had been done, Tom meanwhile
looking down, the young inventor cried:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There she is! We’ve spotted them. The
blue machine is down there! Now for a trick!”</p>

<div><h1 id='ch24'>CHAPTER XXIV<br/> <span class='sub-head'>A NIGHT WATCH</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Tom Swift</span> made up his mind quickly. He
generally did so in an emergency, and this was
one of those times. While he still held the
powerful glasses focused on that clump of trees
amid the green of which he had spotted that
glimpse of blue, he called to Ned:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Put her about five points to the south!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The south?” cried Ned. “What’s the idea!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I want to throw those fellows—if they’re
down there, as I think they are—off the track,”
explained Tom. “It’s just a trick which may
work and may not. They’ll either see us or
hear our motor down where they are. And if
they see us sheer off to the south they may take
us for a mail plane. At any rate, they may not
suspect that we’re after them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I guess that’s good reasoning,” murmured
Ned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Accordingly, he shifted the steering wheel
until the <span class='it'>Blackbird</span> did as many of her namesakes
do when winter approaches—she headed
for the south.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How far on this course?” asked Ned as his
chum continued to gaze down through the
glasses.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Just far enough to take us out of their sight.
Then we’ll go down.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Go down?” cried Ned, in some surprise.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. We’ll make a landing and then come
back by auto. I’ve got it all planned out. If
we try to make a landing near those fellows
they’ll spot us and light out, taking my chest
with them. But if we go down in some spot
a few miles off and then come back by auto, we
can get pretty close to them before they suspect
anything.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“More good dope,” decided Ned, after thinking
it over. “Do you think they’re the fellows
you want, Tom?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s hard to say. That’s a blue aeroplane
down there, I’m sure. But whether it’s the same
one the robbers used isn’t so sure. However,
I’m taking no chances.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It did not take long for the <span class='it'>Blackbird</span> to put
enough distance between her and the place
where the blue aeroplane had been sighted to
make it safe to descend. Now that he could no
longer hold the glasses focused on the clump of
trees, Tom put them aside and took charge of
his craft.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you think you can get back to this same
place in an auto?” Ned questioned, as they
looked about for a good field in which to land.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think so,” was the answer. “I picked out
a few prominent objects by which to plot a return
course.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>This was all that could be done under the
circumstances, and a few minutes later, noting
a broad and level field below them, Tom began
to guide the <span class='it'>Blackbird</span> downward.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I hope we meet as good a chap as our farmer
friend, Kimball, was,” remarked Ned, as they
lightly struck the grass-covered earth and taxied
across it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I hope so,” echoed Tom. “But we’ll buy our
way if we have to. It’s important to get back
as soon as we can to where those fellows are.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>This landing of the <span class='it'>Blackbird</span> attracted more
attention than on the occasion when the travelers
landed in Mr. Kimball’s field. No sooner
was the machine at rest, and while Tom, Ned
and Koku were alighting, than a crowd of men,
women, boys and girls began to flock toward it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Guess they think we’re giving an exhibition,”
laughed Ned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Shouldn’t wonder,” agreed Tom. “But the
first thing we’ve got to do is to make sure our
machine will be all right if we leave it here.
Then we’ve got to hire a car to get back to the
place where those scoundrels are.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A lot of work ahead of us,” commented Ned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was little time to say more, for by this
time the advance crowd of the curious ones was
at the <span class='it'>Blackbird</span>. The boys, especially, would
have overrun the craft and climbed up on her
in their eagerness, but Tom told Koku to act as
a guard. Even the sight of the giant was enough
to drive back the most venturesome of the lads,
while Koku’s actions, in parading around the
craft with a big stick he picked up served as a
further effective deterrent. Curiosity, too, was
about equally divided between Koku and the
machine.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Among those who came rushing to the field
to see why the aeroplane had landed, was the
owner of the property. At first he seemed a
bit belligerent, and it looked as if he would
make trouble. But Tom knew just how to
handle his kind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We want to rent this field for a while, just
to store our machine here,” said the young inventor
in a business-like way. “I’m willing to
pay well for the accommodation. And I’d like
to engage you or some of your men to act as
caretakers while we are away. No one must
meddle with this machine!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll see to that all right,” answered the
farmer, who changed his manner when he
learned that he was to make money out of the
affair. “Now you fellows get away from here!”
he cried. “This is private property and you
can’t trespass on it or I’ll have the law on you!
Move off!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You can’t order us off, Jason Stern, unless
you’ve got signs up saying ‘no trespass,’ ” declared
one man. “I know the law as well as
you do!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll have the signs up before you can say
Jack Robinson!” was the answer. “Tume,” he
called to a tall, lanky youth, evidently one of his
hired men, “you go back to the barn and get
that trespass sign I put up in my orchard when
apples are ripe. Then you and Ben and Jake
stand guard here. Bring my shotgun and a
pitchfork or two. We’ll see who’s boss here!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The farmer was evidently no favorite with
his neighbors, for there were boos and hisses at
this. But on the present occasion Tom Swift
was just suited with this sort of man. It insured
his craft being well looked after. And a
little later, the crowd having been driven from
the field, the hired men went on guard.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now, where can I hire a good automobile?”
asked Tom of the farmer, who had been called
Jason Stern.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you mean a tin Lizzie?” asked the man.
“We call them pretty good cars around here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They are good,” conceded the young inventor.
“But I’m afraid I’ll need a bigger one.
I’ve got to take him along,” and he pointed to
Koku who was indulging in his favorite pastime
of tossing big rocks in the air and catching them
to the no small astonishment of the hired
men.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Say, he is a big fellow!” exclaimed Mr.
Stern. “Well, the best thing you can do is to
go to Nathan’s garage. Tell him I sent you and
he won’t gouge you on the price. He’s dealt
with me before,” and Jason Stern said this with
an air that boded no good for Mr. Nathan
should the latter try any unfair tactics.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Arranging to have some one on guard over
his <span class='it'>Blackbird</span> night and day until he should return,
Tom and his friends set off to the village.
They found Nathan’s garage and quickly arranged
to hire a big touring car, with room in
it for Koku.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’ll put in something to eat and take some
blankets along,” decided Tom. “No telling how
long we may be on the road, and I don’t want to
have to stop and put up at a hotel. We’ll either
camp out in the open or sleep in the car. The
nights are warm.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Suits me,” agreed Ned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Of course saying nothing of their object, the
travelers started off in the machine, Tom heading
it to the north and as near as he could judge
in the general direction of the bandits and where
the blue machine had last been observed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tom Swift’s training had made him a careful
observer, and it was not idly that he had told
Ned he had marked the place where the trees
sheltered the blue aeroplane. After one or two
false turns, the young inventor got on the right
road, and as evening was falling he guided the
machine along a country thoroughfare in a
sparsely settled neighborhood.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Coming upon a lonely cabin where an aged
man and his wife lived, Tom inquired whether
they had heard of an aeroplane landing in that
vicinity lately.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yep,” replied the old man. “A big blue
flyin’ machine come down in a lot over by the
river early this morning. I went over to see
it. Say, I didn’t ever believe there was such
things. I’d never seen one before except in pictures.
Hattie here, she won’t believe I saw it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You can’t tell me!” declared the man’s wife.
“Nobody can fly in the air! I never believed
it and I never will. It’s agin nature!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Leaving the queer couple, but satisfied that
they were on the right track, Tom and his companions
rode on until further inquiries gave
them the information that they were within
half a mile of the place where the aeroplane, for
some reason, had come down.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’d better not take the auto very close,”
said Tom. “They might suspect something,
though I suppose they have been as overwhelmed
with curious ones as we were back there.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It will be better to go up easy, I think,”
agreed Ned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Accordingly, the auto was parked in a secluded
place, and, taking Koku with them to
identify the robbers should the men prove to be
those under suspicion, the chums cautiously approached
the clump of trees.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As they drew near they could see that a sort
of camp had been established about the aeroplane
which was painted blue. It was a large
machine, as Koku had said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Several men were observed moving about a
small tent that had been set up, and in the light
of lanterns Tom and Ned counted five separate
figures. They crept near enough to overhear
some of the talk.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, Blodgett, what’s the next move?” some
one asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tom nudged Ned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s the man Mary heard spoken of,” he
whispered. “He’s the one who was going to
‘fix things.’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He seems to have done so,” murmured Ned
grimly. “Listen!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, we might as well divide the stuff and
separate,” came the answer to the one who had
asked Blodgett the question. And at the sound
of this voice Tom whispered:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s Barsky. I’m sure of it!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sounds like him!” agreed Ned. “The plot
is thickening!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They listened further.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” went on the man who had suggested
dividing the loot, “I tried the old man on the
telephone, but he got wise and tried to catch me
by sending some one to another telephone to
trace the call. I don’t think he succeeded, however.
If we could sell him the stuff back we
might make more than by separating it. But
since he won’t deal with us we’ll have to do
something else.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We want our shares!” exclaimed another
voice, and at the sound of it Ned started.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s the matter?” asked Tom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I should know who that is,” was the answer.
“The voice is familiar. I’m trying to think
where I’ve heard it before.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was some further talk among the
thieves.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What are we going to do, Tom?” asked Ned,
after a while.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Stay here on night watch for a while,” was
the answer. “If we get a chance we’ll slip in
and take away the chest. I want to get it back
before they start dividing the papers. If that
happens I may lose some of them forever.
Those fellows will likely get careless and not
keep guard all night. That will give us the
chance we want. Koku can pick up the chest
and carry it away for us. We’ll stay here and
watch for a while.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was about an hour later, while still keeping
watch, that Ned caught a glimpse of a figure
moving about the bandit camp. The man
limped slightly, and as he was carrying a lantern
Ned saw his elbow thrown out in a peculiar
way.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Renwick Fawn!” he exclaimed. “Now I
know whose voice that was! It was that of the
man who unjustly accused my father of taking
the Liberty Bonds! Renwick Fawn is among
those who robbed you, Tom!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Whew!” whistled the young inventor. “I
should say the plot is thickening!”</p>

<div><h1 id='ch25'>CHAPTER XXV<br/> <span class='sub-head'>THE ROUND-UP</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Tom Swift</span> felt that he was on the verge of
several important discoveries, now that he had
located the scoundrels in the blue machine. The
knowledge that Renwick Fawn was among them
was startling. So was the information that
Blodgett and Barsky were one and the same
person.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I guess this whole thing was engineered
when the men who were associated with Blythe
found I wouldn’t do business with them,” whispered
Tom. “I don’t believe Blythe had anything
to do with the plot. He just saw a good
chance to make money, and he would have dealt
honestly, I’m sure. But the others aren’t of
that type.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course that accusation against my father
about the Liberty Bonds has nothing to do with
the theft of your box, Tom,” put in Ned. “But
it shows that Fawn is in with criminals, and
that’s enough to make me suspect him. I
shouldn’t be surprised but what he stole the
bonds himself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Maybe he did,” agreed Tom. “And if
they’re in that machine we are going to get
them back.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How?” asked Ned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll show you,” was the answer. “Wait
until it gets a little later and they go to sleep,
as I think they will.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Not knowing how long they would have to
remain at their vigil and feeling somewhat chilly
in spite of the fact that Tom had said the nights
were warm, they decided to send Koku back
for the blankets left in the auto. With these
wrapped about them they were in better condition
to remain on guard.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As the young inventor had suggested, the robbers
were not particular to maintain a guard.
The two friends watched the fellows cooking
their evening meal and rather envied them as
the odor of a savory stew came to their noses,
for all Tom, Ned and Koku had were cold victuals.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Finally the camp of the robbers grew quiet,
though for a time an occasional figure could be
seen moving about the tent. At last even this
did not occur, and Tom guessed that all were
asleep.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m going to slip over there and fix things
so they can’t get away,” Tom whispered to Ned.
“Once we make sure they can’t move the aeroplane
and my chest, we can go back and get the
police to round them up. You and Koku stay
here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What you do, Master?” inquired the giant,
in as low a voice as possible, when he saw Tom
stealing out of the bushes where they were
hiding.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m going to put them on the blink, Koku,”
was the answer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You kill ’um while ’um sleep?” the giant
asked, not understanding Tom’s slang. “Let
Koku kill! ’Um tie Koku up—now Koku kill!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The giant was eager to wreak vengeance on
those who had so mistreated him. But Tom
said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hold yourself in, you blood-thirsty man-mountain!
There’s going to be no killing!
Anyway, I want to catch those fellows. Mr.
Newton’s vindication may depend on getting
them alive.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Losing interest when he found he could not
attack the men with his fists, Koku sank back
beside Ned while Tom, as cautious as an Indian,
made his way toward the camp of the
scoundrels. His object was to disable the aeroplane,
rendering it incapable of rising in case
the men tried to make a sudden flight.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Knowing all about aircraft as he did, it was
an easy matter for the young inventor to remove
a small portion of the mechanism—one that
would probably be the last thing to be missed by
the robbers in case they looked for a reason for
their machine not taking off.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll just take off the distributor,” decided
Tom. This was a small affair of hard rubber,
about as big as one’s thumb, and shaped not unlike
it. On it were some pieces of metal, and
it rotated in the timing case, distributing the
electric current to the different spark plugs in
the cylinders in proper order for firing them as
the gas charge entered. Without its distributor
an aeroplane or a motor car is as helpless as
though it had no gas.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Slipping around behind the tent and moving
so cautiously that he did not disturb the sleeping
men, Tom climbed up on the big blue machine.
His first thought was to look for his
chest of secrets, and he saw it stowed away in
the fuselage. He felt a fierce desire to bring
Koku there and carry away the box. But he
knew this would make a noise and arouse the
men. With the help of his giant, Tom knew
he could have beaten off the five, but he wanted
to capture them as well as get back his chest,
and by crippling the aeroplane he thought this
could be brought about.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Having made sure that his chest was there,
though of the contents he could not be so sure,
the young inventor removed the distributor
from the motor and slipped back to his friends.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now, Ned,” he told his friend, “it’s your
turn. Go back to the auto, ride into town and
explain matters to the police. Arrange to have
them assemble here at dawn and raid the place.
Koku and I will remain on guard.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Right-o!” whispered Ned, as he made ready
to leave.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Several hours passed, with Tom and Koku
wrapped in their blankets, waiting. The camp
of the robbers remained quiet and dark.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At last there was a movement near Tom. He
started, for he had fallen into a doze and for a
moment he thought he was being attacked by
the robbers. But Ned’s voice whispered in his
ear:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve brought the police. They’ve surrounded
the camp and they’ll make the round-up as soon
as you give the word.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wait until it gets a bit lighter,” decided
Tom, for dawn was breaking. “We don’t want
any of them to get away.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Koku catch ’um!” muttered the giant.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ned had done his work well, bringing back
the chief of police of Fenwick, the town near
which the robbers were camped, and with the
chief came a score of men, for no chances were
being taken.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A signal had been agreed upon, and when it
was light enough to see, Tom gave it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was a concerted rush upon the camp,
and the robbers were taken completely by surprise.
Two tried to start the aeroplane, but
though the propellers were spun there was no
answering roar of the motor, for they were dead
with the removal of the distributor which reposed
snugly in Tom’s pocket.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Some of the men showed fight, but the police
soon subdued them. Koku rushed up to Renwick
Fawn and, catching hold of him, shook
him as a dog shakes a rat. The giant then
caught Barsky and was about to bang together
the heads of the two men, and probably would
have killed them, when Tom cried for him to
stop.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why stop?” demanded Koku. “ ’Um tie me
up in knots. Now I bust ’um in mince pies!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But he was prevailed upon to release the
greatly frightened men, who were then handcuffed
with the others and put in the police auto.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, Barsky, you didn’t think I’d get out of
the cistern so easily, did you?” asked Tom of
the red-haired man.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A snarl was the only answer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are these yours?” asked the chief of police,
as he showed Tom a bundle of Liberty Bonds.
“We found them in a tin box in the tent.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They’re mine!” cried Renwick Fawn, throwing
out his elbow in the peculiar manner that
identified him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think they’re the ones you accused my
father of stealing,” said Ned. “Hold on to them,
Chief.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I will, young man,” was the cool answer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sullen and defiant, the prisoners were taken
to jail. Then with Koku’s help Tom’s chest of
secrets, with the papers, plans and patents intact,
as the young inventor ascertained by a
quick inspection, was taken to a storage vault in
a local bank until it could be removed to Shopton.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I must telephone dad the good news,” Tom
said, when the robbers were safely disposed of.
And when Tom got into communication with
Mr. Swift the latter expressed his delight
and also told of the mysterious message demanding
a reward for the return of the box.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll pay myself the reward,” chuckled Tom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Little remains to be told. As Ned suspected,
the Liberty Bonds were those stolen from the
Investment Company and it was proved that
Fawn had taken them. Barsky and Blodgett
were one and the same, as Tom suspected, and
he was one of the prime movers in the plot to
steal Tom’s secrets. He and others were sent
to prison for long terms.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Blythe had acted in good faith, knowing
nothing of the character of the men, who, for
their own selfish ends, sought to have him act
for them. They had plotted to get Tom’s
papers, thinking that when they had possession
of them they could force him to come to
terms in the sale of his tidal engine and other
devices.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Accordingly, after open measures had failed,
trickery was resorted to. Blodgett, disguised
as a Russian pattern-maker, sought and obtained
employment. When he found he could
not sneak away with the papers, because of the
big chest, he attacked Tom, put him out of the
way, and then so arranged matters that his confederates
entered the place in the night, overpowered
Koku, and left with the chest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The men made good their escape, after tying
Koku to the tree, and they had hoped to fly to
the fastness of the western mountains, where
they expected to make terms with Tom. But
one of the gang, who was anxious to get cash in
a hurry, persuaded them to land in the place
near the trees and try to get money from the
Swifts by offering to return the chest. It was
this that caused the robbers to go into camp.
They expected to open negotiations again over
the telephone. However, Tom spoiled their
plans.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I’m not going to take any more chances,”
decided the young inventor several days later.
“I’m going to have a special vault made to hold
my chest of secrets.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And when you don’t have to worry about
them I suppose you’ll start and make something
new, won’t you Tom?” asked Ned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I guess so,” was the answer. “But just
now I’m going to pay a visit to a friend of
mine.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And Ned knew without asking just where
Tom Swift was going.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In this line of books there is revealed the whole workings
of a great American railroad system. There are adventures
in abundance—railroad wrecks, dashes through forest fires,
the pursuit of a “wildcat” locomotive, the disappearance of
a pay car with a large sum of money on board—but there
is much more than this—the intense rivalry among railroads
and railroad men, the working out of running schedules,
the getting through “on time” in spite of all obstacles, and
the manipulation of railroad securities by evil men who
wish to rule or ruin.</p>
